He already had a passion for natural history from his childhood, which largely influenced his career, and he accompanied Sedgwick in 1819 on a tour in the Isle of Wight where he learned his first lessons in geology. He also studied chemistry under Professor James Cumming and mineralogy under Edward Daniel Clarke. In the autumn of 1819 he made valuable observations on the geology of the Isle of Man (Trans. Geol. Soc., 1821) and in 1820 and 1821 he investigated the geology of parts of Anglesey, the results being printed in the first volume of the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (1822). The Philosophical Society was founded in November 1819 by a group at Cambridge with Professors Farish, Lee, and Sedgwick and Henslow (at that time not yet a professor). The idea and initial impetus for the society originated from Sedgwick and Henslow.\nMeanwhile, Henslow had studied mineralogy with considerable zeal, so that on the death of Clarke he was in 1822 appointed professor of mineralogy in the University of Cambridge. Two years later he took holy orders. Botany, however, had claimed much of his attention, and to this science he became more and more attached, so that he gladly resigned the chair of mineralogy in 1827, two years after becoming professor of botany. As a teacher both in the classroom and in the field he was eminently successful. He was a correspondent of John James Audubon who in 1829 named Henslow\'s sparrow (Centronyx henslowii) after him.\nFrom 1821 Henslow had begun organising a herbarium of British flora, supplementing his own collecting with a network which expanded over time to include his friends and family, and the botanists William Jackson Hooker and John Hutton Balfour, as well as about 30 of his students. As a mineralogist he had used Haüy\'s laws of crystallography to analyse complex crystals as transformations of ""the primitive form of the species"" of crystal, and when he moved to botany in 1825 he sought similarly precise laws to group plant varieties into species, often including as varieties plants that respected taxonomists had ranked as separate species. He followed the understanding of the time that species were fixed as created but could vary within limits, and hoped to analyse these limits of variation. By a method he called ""collation"", Henslow prepared sheets with several plant specimens, each labelled with the collector, date and place of collection, comparing the specimens to show the variation within the species. His A Catalogue of British Plants was first published in October 1829, and became a set book for his lecture course.\nHenslow is remembered as friend and mentor to his pupil Charles Darwin, and for inspiring him with a passion for natural history. The two met in 1828. Earlier that year, Darwin joined the course and along with other students helped to collect plants of Cambridgeshire. Henslow became his tutor, and it was not long before he marked out Darwin as a promising student. In 1830 Henslow experimented on varying the conditions of garden grown wild plants to produce various forms of the plant. In 1835 Henslow published Principles of Descriptive and Physiological Botany as a textbook based on this lecture course.\nIn the summer of 1831 Henslow was offered a place as naturalist to sail aboard the survey ship HMS Beagle on a two-year voyage to survey South America, but his wife dissuaded him from accepting. Seeing a perfect opportunity for his protégé, Henslow wrote to the ship\'s captain Robert Fitzroy telling him that Darwin was the ideal man to join the expedition team. During the voyage, Darwin corresponded with Henslow, and collected plants with him in mind. In particular, when first arriving at the Galápagos Islands Darwin noted ""I certainly recognize S America in Ornithology, would a botanist?"", and went on to collect plant specimens carefully labelled by island and date. He also labelled the mockingbirds he caught, and initially thought these were varieties but while arranging these bird specimens on the last lap of the voyage he began wondering if they could be species, a possibility which would ""undermine the stability of Species"". Henslow\'s teaching continued to influence Darwin\'s work on evolution.\nBesides Darwin, other famous students of Henslow included Miles Joseph Berkeley, Cardale Babington, Leonard Jenyns, Richard Thomas Lowe and William Hallowes Miller.']","John Stevens Henslow's early education and career choices were deeply influenced by his passion for natural history, which is evident from several key aspects of his academic pursuits and professional appointments.

1. **Education at St. John’s College, Cambridge**: Henslow was educated at St. John’s College, where he graduated as the 16th wrangler in 1818. This achievement indicates a strong foundation in mathematics and science, which are essential for studying natural history.

2. **Interest in Geology**: His passion for natural history began early in his life and significantly influenced his career choices. In 1819, Henslow accompanied Adam Sedgwick on a tour of the Isle of Wight to learn geology, marking one of his first formal engagements with geological studies. This experience laid the groundwork for his future contributions to geology.

3. **Studies in Chemistry and Mineralogy**: Henslow furthered his education by studying chemistry under Professor James Cumming and mineralogy under Edward Daniel Clarke. These disciplines are closely related to natural history, as they involve understanding the composition and structure of natural materials.

4. **Professional Appointments**:
   - In 1822, following the death of Edward Daniel Clarke, Henslow was appointed professor of mineralogy at the University of Cambridge. This appointment reflects his expertise and passion for studying minerals.
   - Two years later, he took holy orders but continued to pursue his interest in natural history by transitioning from mineralogy to botany. In 1827, he became a professor of botany, indicating a shift towards plant sciences.

5. **Botanical Work**: Henslow's work in botany included organizing a herbarium of British flora and developing methods like ""collation"" to study plant variation. His efforts culminated in the publication of *A Catalogue of British Plants* in 1829, which became an essential resource for his lecture course.

6. **Influence on Students**: Henslow's passion for natural history was also reflected in his mentorship of students like Charles Darwin, whom he inspired with a love for natural sciences. His teaching methods and experimental work in botany influenced many future scientists.

Overall, John Stevens Henslow’s early education and career choices were deeply intertwined with his passion for natural history, as evidenced by his studies in geology, chemistry, mineralogy, and botany, along with his professional roles that allowed him to explore these fields further.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4),./data/John_Stevens_Henslow.csv
624,How did changes in architectural style and political circumstances influence the development and features of Westminster Abbey from the 14th to the 16th century?,"['=== Completion of the Gothic church ===\nFrom 1376, Abbot Nicholas Litlyngton and Richard II donated large sums to finish the church. The remainder of the old nave was pulled down and rebuilding commenced, with his mason Henry Yevele closely following the original design even though it was now more than 100 years out of date. During the Peasants\' Revolt of 1381, Richard prayed at Edward the Confessor\'s shrine for ""divine aid when human counsel was altogether wanting"" before meeting the rebels at Smithfield. In the modern day, the abbey holds Richard\'s full-length portrait, the earliest of an English king, on display near the west door.\nBuilding work was not fully complete for many years. Henry V, disappointed with the abbey\'s unfinished state, gave extra funds towards the rebuilding. In his will, he left instructions for a chantry chapel to be built over his tomb; the chapel can be seen from ground level. Between 1470 and 1471, because of fallout from the Wars of the Roses, Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of Edward IV, took sanctuary at Westminster Abbey while her husband was deposed, and gave birth to Edward V in the abbot\'s house. In 1495, building work finally reached the end of the nave, finishing with the west window.\nUnder Henry VII, the 13th-century Lady chapel was demolished and rebuilt in a Perpendicular Gothic style; it is known as the Henry VII Chapel. Work began in 1503 and the main structure was completed by 1509, although decorative work continued for several years afterwards. Henry\'s original reason for building such a grand chapel was to have a place suitable for the burial of another saint alongside the Confessor, as he planned on having Henry VI canonised. The Pope asked Henry VII for a large sum of money to proclaim Henry VI a saint; Henry VII was unwilling to pay the sum, and so instead he is buried in the centre of the chapel with his wife, Elizabeth of York, rather than a large raised shrine like the Confessor.\nA view of the abbey dated 1532 shows a lantern tower above the crossing, but this is not shown in any later depiction. It is unlikely that the loss of this feature was caused by any catastrophic event: structural failure seems more likely. Other sources maintain that a lantern tower was never built. The current squat pyramid dates from the 18th century; the painted wooden ceiling below it was installed during repairs to World War II bomb damage.\nIn the early 16th century, a project began under Abbot John Islip to add two towers to the western end of the church. These had been partially built up to roof level when building work stopped due to uncertainty caused by the English Reformation.']","From the 14th to the 16th century, Westminster Abbey underwent significant developments influenced by both architectural styles and political circumstances:

1. **Architectural Style**:
   - The rebuilding efforts initiated in 1376 under Abbot Nicholas Litlyngton and Richard II adhered closely to the original Gothic design despite being over a century old. This reflects a respect for traditional Gothic architecture.
   - Henry V's dissatisfaction with the unfinished state of the abbey led to additional funding, which continued the Gothic style but also included his chantry chapel, visible from ground level.
   - The 15th-century saw further architectural evolution with the demolition and rebuilding of the Lady Chapel in a Perpendicular Gothic style under Henry VII. This style was characterized by strong vertical lines and large windows, marking a shift from earlier Gothic designs.

2. **Political Circumstances**:
   - During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, Richard II's visit to Edward the Confessor’s shrine at Westminster Abbey highlights its political significance as a place for royal supplication.
   - The abbey served as a sanctuary during the tumultuous period of the Wars of the Roses. Elizabeth Woodville sought refuge there in 1470-71 when her husband was deposed, illustrating the abbey's role as a safe haven amidst political instability.
   - Henry VII’s decision to build the grand Henry VII Chapel was influenced by his initial intention to have Henry VI canonized. However, due to financial disagreements with the Pope over the canonization process, he chose instead to bury himself and Elizabeth of York there, demonstrating how political negotiations impacted architectural decisions.

3. **Structural Changes**:
   - The planned lantern tower above the crossing, depicted in a 1532 view but absent in later depictions, suggests structural changes possibly due to design reconsiderations or failures.
   - Under Abbot John Islip in the early 16th century, plans for two towers at the western end were halted by the English Reformation. This reflects how religious and political shifts directly influenced architectural projects.

Overall, Westminster Abbey's development during this period was a complex interplay of maintaining traditional Gothic styles while adapting to new Perpendicular Gothic influences, all within a backdrop of significant political events that shaped its architecture and function.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4),./data/6_wiki_pages.csv

Henslow's mentorship of Charles Darwin had a profound and lasting impact.  It primarily influenced Darwin’s scientific development by:

*   **Inspiring a Passion for Natural History:** Henslow’s dedication to natural history, coupled with his encouragement of Darwin, ignited a fervent passion for exploring the natural world in Darwin.
*   **Providing a Focused Approach:** Henslow’s meticulous work on taxonomy and the study of plant varieties allowed Darwin to develop a precise, analytical approach to classifying and understanding plant life. His work on collation (carefully preparing and comparing plant specimens) fostered a systematic and detailed method for studying variation and species.
*   **Driving Darwin’s Evolutionary Thinking:** Henslow’s teachings, particularly his emphasis on the principle of ""collation,"" directly contributed to Darwin’s development of evolutionary theory by fostering a logical framework for analyzing variations within species, leading him to consider the gradual change of species over time.
*   **Influence on his Research:** Through his correspondence with Darwin, and during the voyage to the Galapagos Islands, Henslow helped shape Darwin’s research and helped him to identify the key areas for further study.

629,What is the primary purpose of Henslow’s work in Hitcham?,"[""== A country clergyman ==\nIn 1833, Henslow was appointed vicar of Cholsey-cum-Moulsford in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He continued to live in Cambridge, only visiting the parish during vacations; he appointed a curate to conduct services and parish business during term-time.\nHowever, his appointment in 1837 to the remunerative Crown living at Hitcham, Suffolk marked a turning-point in his life. This time, in 1839, he moved to the parish, and as rector of Hitcham he lived at the rectory. He worked there, endearing himself to all who knew him, until the end of his life. His energies were devoted to the improvement of his parishioners, but his influence was felt far and wide. Botany at Cambridge suffered, attendance at lectures fell, and we have records of complaints made within the university. Henslow did not resign his chair, and continued to give lectures, set and mark exams, and take part in university affairs. Nevertheless, his influence there was naturally much reduced.\nHenslow's work in Hitcham, over and above the normal duties of a Rector, can be summarised as follows:\n\n1. The Parish School and other charities. Hitcham was a poor parish, and most people would have been illiterate. Education had to be paid for, and so Henslow both raised funds and donated his own money to support a school. The school was founded in 1841, and Henslow himself gave a series of volunteer classes on Monday afternoons for some of the older children. The botanical curriculum was printed.The botany taught in this school had effects throughout Britain, because important people at the centre, such as Prince Albert and Lyon Playfair kept in touch and rightly regarded Henslow as an authority on the subject.\n2. Adult education in the Village. The Hitcham Labourers' and Mechanics' Horticultural Society was the vehicle used by Henslow to 'improve' the labouring and agricultural workers in the village and its surrounds.  Competitions, shows and excursions were the attractions, and the intent was practical, to improve agriculture by educating the parishioners. Henslow made use of gifts and facilities provided by his friends. Advances such as made by Justus von Liebig in Germany, who began to apply chemistry to the needs of agriculture, had not yet become widely utilised.\n3. Museums. The town of Ipswich is twelve miles from Hitcham. As a result of his Cambridge experiences, Henslow believed in the value of museums as vehicles for education. Ipswich Museum was established in 1847 as a natural history museum and owed much to Henslow, who was elected its President in 1850.\nAlongside this work he remained an inquiring scientist at heart. In 1843 he discovered nodules of coprolitic origin in the Red Crag at Felixstowe in Suffolk, and two years later he called attention to those also in the Cambridge Greensand and remarked that they might be of use in agriculture. Although Henslow derived no benefit, these discoveries led to the establishment of the phosphate industry in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire; and the works proved lucrative until the introduction of foreign phosphates.\nIn 1851, Carl Ludwig Blume named a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Santalaceae, from Indo-China as Henslowia, in honour of Henslow.\nHenslow died on 16 May 1861 at Hitcham.\n\n\n== Family ==\nHenslow married Harriet Jenyns (1797–1857), daughter of George Leonard Jenyns and sister of Leonard Jenyns on 16 December 1823. Their eldest daughter Frances Harriet married Joseph Dalton Hooker, and their youngest daughter, Anne, became a botanical artist. Their sons included George Henslow (1835–1925), who became the Royal Horticultural Society's Professor of Botany and the first President of the Churchmen's Union for the Advancement of Liberal Religious Thought.""]","
Henslow’s primary purpose in Hitcham was to improve the parish’s education and the livelihood of its people. Specifically, he raised funds for a school, educated the villagers through vocational training, fostered agricultural improvements through a horticultural society, established a museum, and contributed to the development of the phosphate industry.

He continued to live in Cambridge, only visiting the parish during vacations; he appointed a curate to conduct services and parish business during term-time.\nHowever, his appointment in 1837 to the remunerative Crown living at Hitcham, Suffolk marked a turning-point in his life. This time, in 1839, he moved to the parish, and as rector of Hitcham he lived at the rectory. He worked there, endearing himself to all who knew him, until the end of his life. His energies were devoted to the improvement of his parishioners, but his influence was felt far and wide. Botany at Cambridge suffered, attendance at lectures fell, and we have records of complaints made within the university. Henslow did not resign his chair, and continued to give lectures, set and mark exams, and take part in university affairs. Nevertheless, his influence there was naturally much reduced.\nHenslow's work in Hitcham, over and above the normal duties of a Rector, can be summarised as follows:\n\n1. The Parish School and other charities. Hitcham was a poor parish, and most people would have been illiterate. Education had to be paid for, and so Henslow both raised funds and donated his own money to support a school. The school was founded in 1841, and Henslow himself gave a series of volunteer classes on Monday afternoons for some of the older children. The botanical curriculum was printed.The botany taught in this school had effects throughout Britain, because important people at the centre, such as Prince Albert and Lyon Playfair kept in touch and rightly regarded Henslow as an authority on the subject.\n2. Adult education in the Village. The Hitcham Labourers' and Mechanics' Horticultural Society was the vehicle used by Henslow to 'improve' the labouring and agricultural workers in the village and its surrounds.  Competitions, shows and excursions were the attractions, and the intent was practical, to improve agriculture by educating the parishioners. Henslow made use of gifts and facilities provided by his friends. Advances such as made by Justus von Liebig in Germany, who began to apply chemistry to the needs of agriculture, had not yet become widely utilised.\n3. Museums. The town of Ipswich is twelve miles from Hitcham. As a result of his Cambridge experiences, Henslow believed in the value of museums as vehicles for education. Ipswich Museum was established in 1847 as a natural history museum and owed much to Henslow, who was elected its President in 1850.\nAlongside this work he remained an inquiring scientist at heart. In 1843 he discovered nodules of coprolitic origin in the Red Crag at Felixstowe in Suffolk, and two years later he called attention to those also in the Cambridge Greensand and remarked that they might be of use in agriculture. Although Henslow derived no benefit, these discoveries led to the establishment of the phosphate industry in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire; and the works proved lucrative until the introduction of foreign phosphates.\nIn 1851, Carl Ludwig Blume named a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Santalaceae, from Indo-China as Henslowia, in honour of Henslow.\nHenslow died on 16 May 1861 at Hitcham.\n\n\n== Family ==\nHenslow married Harriet Jenyns (1797–1857), daughter of George Leonard Jenyns and sister of Leonard Jenyns on 16 December 1823. Their eldest daughter Frances Harriet married Joseph Dalton Hooker, and their youngest daughter, Anne, became a botanical artist. Their sons included George Henslow (1835–1925), who became the Royal Horticultural Society's Professor of Botany and the first President of the Churchmen's Union for the Advancement of Liberal Religious Thought.""]","1.

It was partly the outcome of a previous club known as the Askesian Society. There were 13 founder members: William Babington, James Parkinson, Humphry Davy, George Bellas Greenough, Arthur Aikin, William Allen, Jacques Louis, Comte de Bournon, Richard Knight, James Laird, James Franck, William Haseldine Pepys, Richard Phillips, and William Phillips. It received its royal charter on 23 April 1825 from George IV.\nSince 1874, the Society has been based at Burlington House, Piccadilly, London. This building houses the Society\'s library, which contains more than 300,000 volumes of books and journals. It is a member of the UK Science Council.\nIn 1907 a decision was made by the Society to admit women as Associates, under the condition they distinguished themselves as geological investigators or submitted their own original research. Women were first allowed to become Fellows of the Society in 1919. Margaret Crosfield became the first, due to alphabetical primacy, of the first eight women to be elected Fellows of the Society, on 21 May 1919. \nIn 1991, the Society merged with the Institution of Geologists, which had been formed in 1977 to represent the geological profession.\nThe Society is a member of the European Federation of Geologists.\nThe Society celebrated its bicentenary in 2007. It ran programmes in the geosciences in Britain and abroad, under the auspices of the science writer and palaeontologist Professor Richard Fortey, the president that year.\n\n\n== Specialist and regional groups ==\nThe Society has 24 specialist groups and 15 regional groups which serve as an opportunity for those with specific interests to meet and discuss their subject or region.

The Lyell Fund and the Murchison Fund are central to the Society's work and were established with specific aims in mind.

The Lyell Fund was established in 1807, under the guidance of the Society's early members, and its primary purpose was to provide financial support for geological research and exploration within Great Britain. This fund aimed to foster geological knowledge and support the development of scientific observation, in particular regarding geology. The Society’s early commitment to this fund reflects a broader desire to encourage the scientific community in Britain to actively explore and understand the country’s geological landscape.

The Murchison Fund, established in 1889, was the result of a substantial donation from the British Government and, crucially, the establishment of the British Geological Survey.  It was designed to finance large-scale geological surveys, particularly in the Murchison region of Western Australia.  The fund was built on the understanding that detailed geological mapping and analysis were crucial for understanding the country’s mineral resources and geological history. It was a direct response to the need for comprehensive geological surveying to aid in the exploitation of valuable resources.

766,What was the primary influence on Darwin's early life and education?,"['== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\n\nDarwin was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family\'s home, The Mount. He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier Robert Darwin and Susannah Darwin (née Wedgwood). His grandfathers Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood were both prominent abolitionists. Erasmus Darwin had praised general concepts of evolution and common descent in his Zoonomia (1794), a poetic fantasy of gradual creation including undeveloped ideas anticipating concepts his grandson expanded.\n\nBoth families were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad\'s Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the local Unitarian Church with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus in attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.\nDarwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the well-regarded University of Edinburgh Medical School with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned taxidermy in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from John Edmonstone, a freed black slave who had accompanied Charles Waterton in the South American rainforest.\nIn Darwin\'s second year at the university, he joined the Plinian Society, a student natural-history group featuring lively debates in which radical democratic students with materialistic views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science. He assisted Robert Edmond Grant\'s investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of marine invertebrates in the Firth of Forth, and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech. One day, Grant praised Lamarck\'s evolutionary ideas. Darwin was astonished by Grant\'s audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus\' journals. Darwin was rather bored by Robert Jameson\'s natural-history course, which covered geology – including the debate between neptunism and plutonism. He learned the classification of plants and assisted with work on the collections of the University Museum, one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.\nDarwin\'s neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who sent him to Christ\'s College, Cambridge, in January 1828, to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country parson. Darwin was unqualified for Cambridge\'s Tripos exams and was required instead to join the ordinary degree course. He preferred riding and shooting to studying.\n\nDuring the first few months of Darwin\'s enrolment at Christ\'s College, his second cousin William Darwin Fox was still studying there. Fox impressed him with his butterfly collection, introducing Darwin to entomology and influencing him to pursue beetle collecting.

Darwin's primary influence on his early life and education was the mentorship of his family. Specifically, his grandfather Erasmus Darwin's praise for evolution, and the influence of the Wedgwood family's abolitionist views, shaped his understanding of the world. The exposure to natural history and collecting, alongside the encouraging influence of his father, contributed to his early fascination with the natural world.

767,A) His father's profession and the family's belief in abolitionism.,"['== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\n\nDarwin was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family\'s home, The Mount. He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier Robert Darwin and Susannah Darwin (née Wedgwood). His grandfathers Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood were both prominent abolitionists. Erasmus Darwin had praised general concepts of evolution and common descent in his Zoonomia (1794), a poetic fantasy of gradual creation including undeveloped ideas anticipating concepts his grandson expanded.\n\nBoth families were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad\'s Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the local Unitarian Church with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus in attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.\nDarwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the well-regarded University of Edinburgh Medical School with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned taxidermy in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from John Edmonstone, a freed black slave who had accompanied Charles Waterton in the South American rainforest.\nIn Darwin\'s second year at the university, he joined the Plinian Society, a student natural-history group featuring lively debates in which radical democratic students with materialistic views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science. He assisted Robert Edmond Grant\'s investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of marine invertebrates in the Firth of Forth, and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech. One day, Grant praised Lamarck\'s evolutionary ideas. Darwin was astonished by Grant\'s audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus\' journals. Darwin was rather bored by Robert Jameson\'s natural-history course, which covered geology – including the debate between neptunism and plutonism. He learned the classification of plants and assisted with work on the collections of the University Museum, one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.\nDarwin\'s neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who sent him to Christ\'s College, Cambridge, in January 1828, to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country parson. Darwin was unqualified for Cambridge\'s Tripos exams and was required instead to join the ordinary degree course. He preferred riding and shooting to studying.\n\nDuring the first few months of Darwin\'s enrolment at Christ\'s College, his second cousin William Darwin Fox was still studying there. Fox impressed him with his butterfly collection, introducing Darwin to entomology and influencing him to pursue beetle collecting. He did this zealously and had some of his finds published in James Francis Stephens\' Illustrations of British entomology (1829–1932).\nThrough Fox, Darwin became a close friend and follower of botany professor John Stevens Henslow. He met other leading parson-naturalists who saw scientific work as religious natural theology, becoming known to these dons as ""the man who walks with Henslow"". When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of William Paley\'s Evidences of Christianity (1795).

768,"According to Darwin, what was the primary objective of the voyage on HMS Beagle?","['=== Survey voyage on HMS Beagle ===\n\nAfter leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a few days with student friends at Barmouth. He returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) naturalist for a self-funded supernumerary place on HMS Beagle with captain Robert FitzRoy, a position for a gentleman rather than ""a mere collector"". The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America. Robert Darwin objected to his son\'s planned two-year voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, Josiah Wedgwood II, to agree to (and fund) his son\'s participation. Darwin took care to remain in a private capacity to retain control over his collection, intending it for a major scientific institution.\nAfter delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations. At intervals during the voyage, his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas, was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected during a calm spell.\n\nOn their first stop ashore at St Jago in Cape Verde, Darwin found that a white band high in the volcanic rock cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of Charles Lyell\'s Principles of Geology, which set out uniformitarian concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,[II] and Darwin saw things Lyell\'s way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology. When they reached Brazil, Darwin was delighted by the tropical forest, but detested the sight of slavery there, and disputed this issue with FitzRoy.\nThe survey continued to the south in Patagonia. They stopped at Bahía Blanca, and in cliffs near Punta Alta Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct mammals beside modern seashells, indicating recent extinction with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He found bony plates like a giant version of the armour on local armadillos. From a jaw and tooth he identified the gigantic Megatherium, then from Cuvier\'s description thought the armour was from this animal. The finds were shipped to England, and scientists found the fossils of great interest. In Patagonia, Darwin came to wrongly believe the territory was devoid of reptiles.\nOn rides with gauchos into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, Darwin gained social, political and anthropological insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of rhea had separate but overlapping territories. Further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as raised beaches at a series of elevations. He read Lyell\'s second volume and accepted its view of ""centres of creation"" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell\'s ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.\nThree Fuegians on board, who had been seized during the first Beagle voyage then given Christian education in England, were returning with a missionary. Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at Tierra del Fuego he met ""miserable, degraded savages"", as different as wild from domesticated animals. He remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with a shared origin and potential for improvement towards civilisation. Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. A year on, the mission had been abandoned. The Fuegian they had named Jemmy Button lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.\n\nDarwin experienced an earthquake in Chile in 1835 and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including mussel-beds stranded above high tide. High in the Andes he saw seashells and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, oceanic islands sank, and coral reefs round them grew to form atolls.\nOn the geologically new Galápagos Islands, Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older ""centre of creation"", and found mockingbirds allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island.']","

769,The context provided is below.,"['He later wrote that such facts ""seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species"".\nWithout telling Darwin, extracts from his letters to Henslow had been read to scientific societies, printed as a pamphlet for private distribution among members of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, and reported in magazines, including The Athenaeum. Darwin first heard of this at Cape Town, and at Ascension Island read of Sedgwick\'s prediction that Darwin ""will have a great name among the Naturalists of Europe"".\n\n\n=== Inception of Darwin\'s evolutionary theory ===\n\nOn 2 October 1836, Beagle anchored at Falmouth, Cornwall. Darwin promptly made the long coach journey to Shrewsbury to visit his home and see relatives. He then hurried to Cambridge to see Henslow, who advised him on finding available naturalists to catalogue Darwin\'s animal collections and to take on the botanical specimens. Darwin\'s father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded gentleman scientist, and an excited Darwin went around the London institutions being fêted and seeking experts to describe the collections. British zoologists at the time had a huge backlog of work, due to natural history collecting being encouraged throughout the British Empire, and there was a danger of specimens just being left in storage.\nCharles Lyell eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October and soon introduced him to the up-and-coming anatomist Richard Owen, who had the facilities of the Royal College of Surgeons to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen\'s surprising results included other gigantic extinct ground sloths as well as the Megatherium Darwin had identified, a near complete skeleton of the unknown Scelidotherium and a hippopotamus-sized rodent-like skull named Toxodon resembling a giant capybara. The armour fragments were actually from Glyptodon, a huge armadillo-like creature, as Darwin had initially thought. These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.\nIn mid-December, Darwin took lodgings in Cambridge to arrange expert classification of his collections, and prepare his own research for publication. Questions of how to combine his diary into the Narrative were resolved at the end of the month when FitzRoy accepted Broderip\'s advice to make it a separate volume, and Darwin began work on his Journal and Remarks.\nDarwin\'s first paper showed that the South American landmass was slowly rising. With Lyell\'s enthusiastic backing, he read it to the Geological Society of London on 4 January 1837. On the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the Zoological Society. The ornithologist John Gould soon announced that the Galápagos birds that Darwin had thought a mixture of blackbirds, ""gros-beaks"" and finches, were, in fact, twelve separate species of finches. On 17 February, Darwin was elected to the Council of the Geological Society, and Lyell\'s presidential address presented Owen\'s findings on Darwin\'s fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his uniformitarian ideas.\n\nEarly in March, Darwin moved to London to be near this work, joining Lyell\'s social circle of scientists and experts such as Charles Babbage, who described God as a programmer of laws. Darwin stayed with his freethinking brother Erasmus, part of this Whig circle and a close friend of the writer Harriet Martineau, who promoted the Malthusianism that underpinned the controversial Whig Poor Law reforms to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a Unitarian, she welcomed the radical implications of transmutation of species, promoted by Grant and younger surgeons influenced by Geoffroy. Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order, but reputable scientists openly discussed the subject, and there was wide interest in John Herschel\'s letter praising Lyell\'s approach as a way to find a natural cause of the origin of new species.\nGould met Darwin and told him that the Galápagos mockingbirds from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a ""wren"" was in the finch group. Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the ship, including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands. The two rheas were distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.\nBy mid-March 1837, barely six months after his return to England, Darwin was speculating in his Red Notebook on the possibility that ""one species does change into another"" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange extinct mammal Macrauchenia, which resembled a giant guanaco, a llama relative. Around mid-July, he recorded in his ""B"" notebook his thoughts on lifespan and variation across generations – explaining the variations he had observed in Galápagos tortoises, mockingbirds, and rheas. He sketched branching descent, and then a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, in which ""It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another"", thereby discarding Lamarck\'s idea of independent lineages progressing to higher forms.']","

The pressures of the Victorian era profoundly influenced Darwin's work and his well-being. Specifically, the intense focus on transmutation, coupled with financial pressures, demanding work hours, and the expectation to produce extensive research, created immense stress. His health suffered, leading to multiple episodes of illness and digestive problems. Furthermore, the demands of the era – such as the need for financial stability and the expectation of producing a legacy – exacerbated his anxieties. The social pressures around marriage, and the lack of immediate success in securing a stable partnership, added to his emotional turmoil, as did the need to maintain a public profile.

Darwin's research concerning human population growth emphasizes the interplay between human population and the availability of resources. He argued that human population is prone to exponential growth, exceeding food supply, leading to what he termed a Malthusian catastrophe.  This leads to the concept of natural selection, where favorable variations increase in frequency and result in new species, a process that continuously reshapes the species.

Darwin compared the population dynamics described in Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population to his own ideas about species struggle and the formation of new organisms by highlighting a similarity between farmers selecting stock through selective breeding and the Malthusian struggle. He viewed this as a ""force like a hundred thousand wedges trying to force into every kind of adapted structure, or forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones."" He then suggested that favourable variations would be preserved and unfavourable would be destroyed, leading to new species.

The text indicates that Darwin's research on barnacles, specifically the study of Mr. Arthrobalanus, was initially driven by a confusion over the phylogenetic relationships of a Cryptophialus minutus. His later work, focused on marine invertebrates, including the study of barnacles and the establishment of homologous structures, involved an intense fascination with the properties of marine organisms.
```

Here's a slightly more detailed answer that builds on this:

```
=== Geology books, barnacles, evolutionary research ===

The passage details Darwin’s methodical approach to studying barnacles, highlighting his initial confusion with their phylogenetic relationships, fueled by a collection from Chile.  This initial focus on the taxonomy of the species, combined with extensive experiments and observations, led to his growing interest in the fundamental principles of evolution, expressed through the framework of natural selection. The initial work on barnacles was a crucial step towards establishing the underlying mechanisms of evolution, particularly concerning homology (similarity in structure despite different functions) and intermediate forms in the evolutionary process. His subsequent research expanded into a broader exploration of marine invertebrates, revealing a deep understanding of evolutionary processes through detailed taxonomic analysis and experimental investigation.

Darwin's research with Mr. Arthrobalanus, especially his study of the species' relationship, was a foundational step in his theory of natural selection. The confusion about the Cryptophialus minutus, and the detailed investigation of the species, fostered a focus on the study of taxa and systematic classification. His careful examination of the species led to a more refined understanding of evolutionary relationships. Ultimately, this focused investigation helped him refine his ideas and articulate his theory of natural selection in a way that was directly linked to the study of barnacles.

The theory of natural selection is described as a principle that states:
1.  Individuals within a species have more offspring than the number of individuals capable of surviving.
2.  There is a struggle for existence, and any being that varies (however slightly) may have a better chance of survival.
3.  The principle of inheritance allows selected variations to propagate, leading to evolutionary change.

---------------------
Charles Darwin was a pioneering naturalist and scientist who revolutionized the field of biology. His work, primarily focused on the theory of natural selection, fundamentally changed our understanding of the natural world and paved the way for modern evolutionary biology.
Here's a breakdown of his significance and contributions:
- **Theory of Natural Selection:** Darwin’s core contribution was the development of the theory of natural selection, a groundbreaking concept that explains how species change over time through variations and adaptation.
- **Observation and Data Collection:** Darwin meticulously observed and collected data from various naturalists worldwide, including Wallace, and amassed a vast database of species and their characteristics.
- **Critical Analysis:** He critically analyzed existing theories of species and recognized the limitations of traditional notions of fixed species.
- **Writing and Publication:** He began writing a “big book” on species, documenting his observations and ideas, and introducing the concept of natural selection to the world.
- **Impact on Science:** His work had a profound impact on science, fostering the growth of evolutionary biology, and influencing countless researchers and scientists.

He is considered a major figure in the history of science, and his legacy continues to inspire and inform scientific thought.

Though Darwin\'s illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and corresponded on it with colleagues worldwide. The book did not explicitly discuss human origins,[IV] but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made.\nThe first review asked, ""If a monkey has become a man – what may not a man become?"" It said this should be left to theologians as being too dangerous for ordinary readers. Among early favourable responses, Huxley\'s reviews swiped at Richard Owen, leader of the scientific establishment which Huxley was trying to overthrow.\nIn April, Owen\'s review attacked Darwin\'s friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin, but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution. Patrick Matthew drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.\nThe Church of England\'s response was mixed. Darwin\'s old Cambridge tutors Sedgwick and Henslow dismissed the ideas, but liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God\'s design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as ""just as noble a conception of Deity"". In 1860, the publication of Essays and Reviews by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted clerical attention from Darwin. Its ideas, including higher criticism, were attacked by church authorities as heresy. In it, Baden Powell argued that miracles broke God\'s laws, so belief in them was atheistic, and praised ""Mr Darwin\'s masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature"".\nAsa Gray discussed teleology with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray\'s pamphlet on theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with natural theology. The most famous confrontation was at the public 1860 Oxford evolution debate during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, though not opposed to transmutation of species, argued against Darwin\'s explanation and human descent from apes. Joseph Hooker argued strongly for Darwin, and Thomas Huxley\'s legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.\nEven Darwin\'s close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education, aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. Owen\'s claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate biological order from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long-running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the ""Great Hippocampus Question"", and discredited Owen.\nIn response to objections that the origin of life was unexplained, Darwin pointed to acceptance of Newton\'s law even though the cause of gravity was unknown. Despite criticisms and reservations related to this topic, he nevertheless proposed a prescient idea in an 1871 letter to Hooker in which he suggested the origin of life may have occurred in a ""warm little pond"".\nDarwinism became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas.

In 1863, Lyell\'s Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley\'s Evidence as to Man\'s Place in Nature showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then The Naturalist on the River Amazons by Henry Walter Bates provided empirical evidence of natural selection. Lobbying brought Darwin Britain\'s highest scientific honour, the Royal Society\'s Copley Medal, awarded on 3 November 1864. That day, Huxley held the first meeting of what became the influential ""X Club"" devoted to ""science, pure and free, untrammelled by religious dogmas"". By the end of the decade, most scientists agreed that evolution occurred, but only a minority supported Darwin\'s view that the chief mechanism was natural selection.\nThe Origin of Species was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the ""working men"" who flocked to Huxley\'s lectures. Darwin\'s theory resonated with various movements at the time[V] and became a key fixture of popular culture.[VI] Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain, these droll images served to popularise Darwin\'s theory in an unthreatening way. While ill in 1862, Darwin began growing a beard, and when he reappeared in public in 1866, caricatures of him as an ape helped to identify all forms of evolutionism with Darwinism.\nOthniel C.

For the first time, Marsh traced the evolution of vertebrates from fish all the way through humans.  Sparing no detail, he listed a wealth of fossil examples of past life forms.

The significance of this speech was immediately recognized by the scientific community, and it was printed in its entirety in several scientific journals.\n\n\n=== Descent of Man, sexual selection, and botany ===\n\nDespite repeated bouts of illness during the last twenty-two years of his life, Darwin\'s work continued. Having published On the Origin of Species as an abstract of his theory, he pressed on with experiments, research, and writing of his ""big book"". He covered human descent from earlier animals, including the evolution of society and of mental abilities, as well as explaining decorative beauty in wildlife and diversifying into innovative plant studies.\nEnquiries about insect pollination led in 1861 to novel studies of wild orchids, showing adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation. In 1862, Fertilisation of Orchids gave his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants. Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinism incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe\'s idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.\nDarwin\'s book The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication (1868) was the first part of his planned ""big book"", and included his unsuccessful hypothesis of pangenesis attempting to explain heredity. It sold briskly at first, despite its size, and was translated into many languages. He wrote most of a second part, on natural selection, but it remained unpublished in his lifetime.\nLyell had already popularised human prehistory, and Huxley had shown that anatomically humans are apes. With The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex published in 1871, Darwin set out evidence from numerous sources that humans are animals, showing continuity of physical and mental attributes, and presented sexual selection to explain impractical animal features such as the peacock\'s plumage as well as human evolution of culture, differences between sexes, and physical and cultural racial classification, while emphasising that humans are all one species. According to an editorial in Nature journal: ""Although Charles Darwin opposed slavery and proposed that humans have a common ancestor, he also advocated a hierarchy of races, with white people higher than others.""\n\nHis research using images was expanded in his 1872 book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, one of the first books to feature printed photographs, which discussed the evolution of human psychology and its continuity with the behaviour of animals. Both books proved very popular, and Darwin was impressed by the general assent with which his views had been received, remarking that ""everybody is talking about it without being shocked."" His conclusion was ""that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system – with all these exalted powers – Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.""\nHis evolution-related experiments and investigations led to books on Insectivorous Plants, The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom, different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and The Power of Movement in Plants. He continued to collect information and exchange views from scientific correspondents all over the world, including Mary Treat, whom he encouraged to persevere in her scientific work. He was the first person to recognise the significance of carnivory in plants. His botanical work[IX] was interpreted and popularised by various writers including Grant Allen and H. G. Wells, and helped transform plant science in the late 19th century and early 20th century.']","
The primary reason for Charles Darwin's intense interest in evolution during the 1870s is that he was determined to trace the evolution of vertebrates from fish all the way through humans, as outlined in his speech before the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and he printed this work in its entirety.

The Darwins' approach to biology is described as being somewhat unconventional. Charles Waring Darwin, who was born in December 1856, demonstrated a keen interest in the natural world, particularly in the study of insects, but this interest was not supported by medical understanding. In the period of his illness, he engaged in thoughtful and imaginative thoughts, which could be interpreted as a form of contemplation.

In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife Emma, whose beliefs similarly came from intensive study and questioning.\nThe theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator\'s laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs. Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver.

Darwin’s family tradition was nonconformist Unitarianism, while his father and grandfather were freethinkers, and his baptism and boarding school were Church of England. He did not ""in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible.""

=== Views and opinions ===

The concept of a universal history is a controversial topic. Some historians argue that it lacks sufficient evidence, while others claim that it is a crucial tool for understanding the past. There are different schools of thought on how to interpret historical sources, with some emphasizing linear narratives and others favoring alternative perspectives that challenge conventional understandings of events.  The interpretation of individual events can be highly subjective, influenced by personal biases and the context of the time.  Furthermore, it is often difficult to determine the motivations of historical actors, making it challenging to reconstruct their actions and intentions. This can lead to a tendency towards ""narrative certainty,"" where the story of the past is presented as immutable and unchanging, despite evidence suggesting it is a constantly evolving interpretation.

787,The question must be an open-ended question.,"['== Evolutionary social movements ==\n\nDarwin\'s fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments.\nThomas Malthus had argued that population growth beyond resources was ordained by God to get humans to work productively and show restraint in getting families; this was used in the 1830s to justify workhouses and laissez-faire economics. Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and Herbert Spencer\'s 1851 book Social Statics based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.\nSoon after the Origin was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a Malthusian justification for the English industrial capitalism of the time. The term Darwinism was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer\'s ""survival of the fittest"" as free-market progress, and Ernst Haeckel\'s polygenistic ideas of human development. Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat-dog capitalism, colonialism and imperialism. However, Darwin\'s holistic view of nature included ""dependence of one being on another""; thus pacifists, socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin stressed the value of cooperation over struggle within a species. Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.\nAfter the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin\'s cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in ""positive eugenics"". During the ""Eclipse of Darwinism"", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by Mendelian genetics. Negative eugenics to remove the ""feebleminded"" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and eugenics in the United States introduced compulsory sterilisation laws, followed by several other countries. Subsequently, Nazi eugenics brought the field into disrepute.[VIII]\nThe term ""Social Darwinism"" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by Richard Hofstadter to attack the laissez-faire conservatism of those like William Graham Sumner who opposed reform and socialism. Since then, it has been used as a term of abuse by those opposed to what they think are the moral consequences of evolution.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nDarwin was a prolific writer. Even without the publication of his works on evolution, he would have had a considerable reputation as the author of The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.']","

The evolution of ideas and social movements related to Darwin's work is complex, reflecting a dynamic interplay of scientific advances, political ideologies, and social anxieties. From the initial misinterpretations of his work by critics to the rise of eugenics and the historical misuse of the term ""Social Darwinism,"" the story of Darwin's legacy is marked by both intellectual challenges and controversial interpretations.

Since 1066, it has been the location of the coronations of 40 English and British monarchs and a burial site for 18 English, Scottish, and British monarchs. At least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey since 1100.\nAlthough the origins of the church are obscure, an abbey housing Benedictine monks was on the site by the mid-10th century. The church got its first large building from the 1040s, commissioned by King Edward the Confessor, who is buried inside. Construction of the present church began in 1245 on the orders of Henry III. The monastery was dissolved in 1559, and the church was made a royal peculiar – a Church of England church, accountable directly to the sovereign – by Elizabeth I.

The primary purpose of the abbey, as described in the document, is to be the burial site for prominent figures in British history. It is described as the location of the coronations of 40 English and British monarchs and a burial site for 18 English, Scottish, and British monarchs. The document also states that it is the location of the abbey's significant spiritual purpose, as well as the burial site of more than 3,300 people.

Since 1066, it has been the location of the coronations of 40 English and British monarchs and a burial site for 18 English, Scottish, and British monarchs. At least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey since 1100.\nAlthough the origins of the church are obscure, an abbey housing Benedictine monks was on the site by the mid-10th century. The church got its first large building from the 1040s, commissioned by King Edward the Confessor, who is buried inside. Construction of the present church began in 1245 on the orders of Henry III. The monastery was dissolved in 1559, and the church was made a royal peculiar – a Church of England church, accountable directly to the sovereign – by Elizabeth I. The abbey, the Palace of Westminster and St Margaret\'s Church became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 because of their historic and symbolic significance.\nThe church\'s Gothic architecture is chiefly inspired by 13th-century French and English styles, although some sections of the church have earlier Romanesque styles or later Baroque and modern styles.

790,I am writing a quiz/examination on the history of Westminster Abbey.,"[""=== Henry III's rebuilding ===\nWestminster Abbey continued to be used as a coronation site, but after Edward the Confessor, no monarchs were buried there until Henry III began to rebuild it in the Gothic style. Henry III wanted it built as a shrine to venerate Edward, to match great French churches such as Rheims Cathedral and Sainte-Chapelle, and as a burial place for himself and his family. Construction began on 6 July 1245 under Henry's master mason, Henry of Reynes. The first building stage included the entire eastern end, the transepts, and the easternmost bay of the nave. The Lady chapel, built from around 1220 at the extreme eastern end, was incorporated into the chevet of the new building.\nPart of the new building included a rich shrine and chapel to Edward the Confessor, of which the base only still stands.  The golden shrine with its jewelled figures no longer exists.  4,000 marks (about £5,800) for this work came from the estate of David of Oxford, the husband of Licoricia of Winchester, and a further £2,500 came from a forced contribution from Licoricia herself, by far the biggest single donation at that time.\nAround 1253, Henry of Reynes was replaced by John of Gloucester, who was replaced by Robert of Beverley around 1260. During the summer, there were up to 400 workers on the site at a time, including stonecutters, marblers, stone-layers, carpenters, painters and their assistants, marble polishers, smiths, glaziers, plumbers, and general labourers. From 1257, Henry III held assemblies of local representatives in Westminster Abbey's chapter house; these assemblies were a precursor to the House of Commons. Henry III also commissioned the Cosmati pavement in front of the High Altar. Further work produced an additional five bays for the nave, bringing it to one bay west of the choir. Here, construction stopped in about 1269. By 1261, Henry had spent £29,345 19s 8d on the abbey, and the final sum may have been near £50,000. A consecration ceremony was held on 13 October 1269, during which the remains of Edward the Confessor were moved to their present location at the shrine behind the main altar. After Henry's death and burial in the abbey in 1272, construction did not resume and Edward the Confessor's old Romanesque nave remained attached to the new building for over a century.\n\nIn 1296, Edward I captured the Scottish coronation stone, the Stone of Scone. He had a Coronation Chair made to hold it, which he entrusted to the abbot at Westminster Abbey. In 1303, the small crypt underneath the chapter house was broken into and a great deal of the king's treasure was stolen. It was thought that the thieves must have been helped by the abbey monks, fifty of whom were subsequently imprisoned in the Tower of London.""]","
Westminster Abbey has undergone significant rebuilding and transformation over its history. It began as a coronation site and later became a shrine to venerate Edward the Confessor, and then a burial place for his family. The construction of the Abbey, especially its Gothic style, was driven by Henry III's desire to reflect the grandeur of French churches and to emulate Edward's legacy. From 1257, the abbey became a site for local assemblies, a precursor to the House of Commons, and a location for the Cosmati pavement. Construction, involving hundreds of workers and a substantial budget, continued until 1269.  The Abbey was further extended with additional bays and a redesigned structure to reflect Edward’s reign and the importance of the church. The events of 1296, including the theft of the Scottish coronation stone and the subsequent imprisonment of the abbey monks, highlight the Abbey's importance to English history and show its resilience throughout the ages.

The construction of Westminster Abbey was a lengthy and complex undertaking, beginning in 1245 under Henry III. It was built as a shrine to venerate Edward the Confessor, incorporating elements of Gothic architecture, and involved a considerable amount of labor.

The monastery was dissolved and the building became the cathedral for the newly created Diocese of Westminster. The abbot, William Benson, became dean of the cathedral, while the prior and five of the monks were among the twelve newly created canons.\nThe Westminster diocese was dissolved in 1550, but the abbey was recognised (in 1552, retroactively to 1550) as a second cathedral of the Diocese of London until 1556. Money meant for the abbey, which is dedicated to St Peter, was diverted to the treasury of St Paul\'s Cathedral; this led to an association with the already-old saying ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"".\nThe abbey saw the return of Benedictine monks under the Catholic Mary I, but they were again ejected under Elizabeth I in 1559. In 1560, Elizabeth re-established Westminster as a ""royal peculiar"" – a church of the Church of England responsible directly to the sovereign, rather than to a diocesan bishop – and made it the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter, a non-cathedral church with an attached chapter of canons, headed by a dean. From that date onwards, the building was simply a church, though it was still called an abbey. Elizabeth also re-founded Westminster School, providing for 40 students (the King\'s (or Queen\'s) Scholars) and their schoolmasters. The King\'s Scholars have the duty of shouting Vivat Rex or Vivat Regina (""Long live the King/Queen"") during the coronation of a new monarch. In the modern day, the dean of Westminster Abbey remains the chair of the school governors.\nIn the early 17th century, the abbey hosted two of the six companies of churchmen who produced the King James Version of the Bible. They used the Jerusalem Chamber in the abbey for their meetings. The First Company was headed by the dean of the abbey, Lancelot Andrewes.\nIn 1642, the English Civil War broke out between Charles I and his own parliament. The Dean and Chapter fled the abbey at the outbreak of war, and were replaced by priests loyal to Parliament. The abbey itself suffered damage during the war; altars, stained glass, the organ, and the Crown Jewels were damaged or destroyed. Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell was given an elaborate funeral there in 1658, only for a body thought to be Cromwell\'s to be disinterred in January 1661 and posthumously hanged from a gibbet at Tyburn. In 1669, the abbey was visited by the diarist Samuel Pepys, who saw the body of the 15th-century queen Catherine de Valois. She had been buried in the 13th-century Lady chapel in 1437, but was exhumed during building work for the Henry VII Chapel and not reburied in the intervening 150 years. Pepys leaned into the coffin and kissed her on the mouth, writing ""This was my birthday, thirty-six years old and I did first kiss a queen."" She has since been re-interred close to her husband, Henry V. In 1685, during preparations for the coronation of James II, a workman accidentally put a scaffolding pole through the coffin of Edward the Confessor. A chorister, Charles Taylour, pulled a cross on a chain out of the coffin and gave it to the king, who then gave it to the Pope. Its whereabouts are unknown.']","
The English Reformation began in the 1530s. Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church in Rome and seized control of England's monasteries, including Westminster Abbey, initiating the process of the English Reformation.

Okay, I understand. Let's answer the next one.
Query:  The Westminster diocese was dissolved in 1550, but the abbey was recognised (in 1552, retroactively to 1550) as a second cathedral of the Diocese of London until 1556. Money meant for the abbey, which is dedicated to St Peter, was diverted to the treasury of St Paul's Cathedral; this led to an association with the already-old saying ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"".
Answer:
The Westminster diocese was dissolved in 1550 but later recognised as a second cathedral of the Diocese of London until 1556.  Money from the abbey, used to support St Peter, was redirected to St Paul's Cathedral, leading to the phrase ""robbing Peter to pay Paul.""

The shrine and tomb of Edward the Confessor are a significant element of the abbey's history and religious significance. They are positioned in the eastern end of the nave, separated from the main church by a stone reredos, creating a semi-private space. The reredos depicts episodes from Edward's life, including his birth and the building of the abbey. The shrine itself was originally covered in coloured glass and stone, picked off by generations of tourists.  The arrangement of the tombs around Henry V, highlighting his importance in the horseshoe shape, underscores Edward's influence and status during the reign of Henry III. Furthermore, the shrine’s inclusion of the shrine and tomb is important because the shrine was once a common place for the dead, and the materials used were heavily embellished, demonstrating a significant effort to commemorate and venerate the king. The shrine itself is closed to the public, except for special events.

801,How did John Leland’s description of the chapel influence the design of the chapel?,"['=== Henry VII Chapel ===\n\nThe Henry VII Lady Chapel, also known simply as the Henry VII Chapel, is a large lady chapel at the far eastern end of the abbey which was paid for by the will of King Henry VII. The chapel, built in late Perpendicular Gothic style, inspired English poet John Leland to call it the orbis miraculum (the wonder of the world). The tombs of several monarchs, including Edward V, Henry VII, Edward VI, Mary I, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles II, George II and Mary, Queen of Scots, are in the chapel.\nIt is noted for its pendant- and fan vault-style ceiling, probably designed by William Vertue, which writer Washington Irving said was ""achieved with the wonderful minuteness and airy security of a cobweb"". The ceiling is not a true fan vault, but a groin vault disguised as a fan vault. The interior walls are densely decorated with carvings, including 95 statues of saints. Many statues of saints in England were destroyed in the 17th century, so these are rare survivors. Like much of the rest of the medieval building, they would originally have been painted and gilded. From outside, The chapel walls are supported from outside by flying buttresses, each in the form of a polygonal tower topped with a cupola. At the centre of the chapel is the tomb of Henry VII and his wife, Elizabeth of York, which was sculpted by Pietro Torrigiano (who fled to England from Italy after breaking Michaelangelo\'s nose in a fight).\nThe chapel has sub-chapels radiating from the main structure. One, to the north, contains the tombs of Mary I and Elizabeth I; both coffins are in Elizabeth\'s monument. Another, to the south, contains the tomb of Mary, Queen of Scots. Both monuments were commissioned by James I, Elizabeth\'s successor to the English throne and Mary\'s son. At the far eastern end is the RAF Chapel, with a stained-glass window dedicated to those who died in the 1940 Battle of Britain. The RAF Chapel was the original burial site of Oliver Cromwell in 1658. Cromwell was disinterred in 1661, after the Stuart Restoration, when his body was hanged in chains on the gallows at Tyburn.\nThe chapel has been the mother church of the Order of the Bath since 1725, and the banners of its members hang above the stalls. The stalls retain their medieval misericords: small ledges for monks to perch on during services, often decorated with varied and humorous carvings.\n\n\n=== Monastic buildings ===\n\nMany rooms used by the monks have been repurposed. The dormitory became a library and a school room, and the monks\' offices have been converted into houses for the clergy. The abbot had his own lodgings, and ate separately from the rest of the monks. The lodgings, now used by the Dean of Westminster, are probably the oldest continuously occupied residence in London. They include the Jericho Parlour (covered in wooden linenfold panelling), the Jerusalem Chamber (commissioned in 1369), and a grand dining hall with a minstrels\' gallery which is now used by Westminster School. The prior also had his own household, separate from the monks, on the site of present-day Ashburnham House in Little Dean\'s Yard (now also part of Westminster School).']","

The collection has about 16,000 volumes. Next to the library is the Muniment Room, where the abbey\'s historic archives are kept.\n\n\n=== Cosmati pavement ===\n\nAt the crossing in front of Edward the Confessor\'s shrine and the main altar is the Cosmati pavement, a 700-year-old tile floor made of almost 30,000 pieces of coloured glass and stone. Measuring almost 25 feet square, coronations take place here.\nThe floor is named after the Cosmati family in Rome, who were known for such work. It was commissioned by Richard Ware, who travelled to Rome in 1258, when he became abbot, and returned with stone and artists. The porphyry used was originally quarried as far away as Egypt, and was presumably brought to Italy during the Roman Empire. It was surrounded by a Latin inscription in brass letters (since lost) identifying the artist as Odericus, probably referring to designer Pietro di Oderisio or his son. The inscription also predicted the end of the world 19,863 years after its creation. Unlike traditional mosaic work, the pieces were not cut to a uniform size but made using a technique known as opus sectile (""cut work""). It is unique among Cosmati floors in Europe for the use of dark Purbeck-marble trays, forming bold borders, instead of the more typical white marble. The pavement influenced later floor treatments at St George\'s Chapel, Windsor Castle, and Canterbury Cathedral.\nGeometric designs, such as those in the pavement, were thought to help the abbey\'s monks with contemplation, and conveyed medieval Christian ideas on the nature of the universe that could not easily be put into words. Much of the design relies on the geometric doubling of the square, considered a trade secret by stonemasons. The four-sided squares, four-fold symmetry, and the four inner roundels of the design represent the four elements of classical philosophy, with the central roundel representing the unformed state of the universe at its creation. Each inner roundel is touched by two bands, which represent the shared qualities of each element; water and air were both considered ""moist"" in classical philosophy, and air and fire were both considered ""hot"".']","1300s.

803,"Describe the types of stained glass used in the abbey from the 13th century onwards, focusing on the changes in materials and the impact of the English Civil War and Blitz.","[""=== Stained glass ===\n\nThe abbey's 13th-century windows would have been filled with stained glass, but much of this was destroyed in the English Civil War and the Blitz and was replaced with clear, plain glass. Since the 19th century, new stained glass, designed by artists such as Ninian Comper (on the north side of the nave) and Hugh Easton and Alan Younger (in the Henry VII Chapel), has replaced clear glass.\nThe north rose window was designed by James Thornhill and made by Joshua Price in 1722; it shows Christ, the apostles (without Judas Iscariot), the Four Evangelists, and, in the centre, the Bible. The window was restored by J. L. Pearson in the 19th century, during which the feet of the figures were cut off. Thornhill also designed the great west window, which shows the Biblical figures of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel underneath.\nIn the Henry VII Chapel, the west window was designed by John Lawson and unveiled in 1995. It depicts coats of arms and cyphers of Westminster Abbey's benefactors, particularly John Templeton (whose coat of arms is prominent in the lower panel). In the centre are the arms of Elizabeth II. The central east window, designed by Alan Younger and dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was unveiled in 2000. It depicts Comet Hale–Bopp, which was passing over the artist's house at the time, as the star of Bethlehem. The donors of the window, Lord and Lady Harris of Peckham, are shown kneeling at the bottom.\nIn 2018, artist David Hockney unveiled a new stained-glass window for the north transept to celebrate the reign of Elizabeth II. It shows a country scene inspired by his native Yorkshire, with hawthorn blossoms and blue skies. Hockney used an iPad to design the window, replicating the backlight that comes through stained glass.\n\n\n=== Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries ===\n\nThe Westminster Abbey Museum was located in the 11th-century vaulted undercroft beneath the former monks' dormitory. This is one of the oldest areas of the abbey, dating almost to the foundation of the church by Edward the Confessor in 1065. This space had been used as a museum since 1908, but was closed to the public when it was replaced as a museum in June 2018 by the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries (high in the abbey's triforium and accessed through the Weston Tower, which encloses a lift and stairs).\nThe exhibits include a set of life-size effigies of English and British monarchs and their consorts, originally made to lie on the coffin in the funeral procession or to be displayed over the tomb. The effigies date from the 14th to the 18th centuries, and some include original clothes.\nOn display in the galleries is The Coronation Theatre, Westminster Abbey: A Portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, a portrait by Ralph Heimans of the queen standing on the Cosmati pavement where she was crowned in 1953. Other exhibits include a model of an unbuilt tower designed by Christopher Wren; a paper model of the abbey as it was for Queen Victoria's 1837 coronation; and the wedding licence of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, who were married in the abbey in 2011.""]","
The abbey's stained glass evolved significantly over the centuries. Initially, it was predominantly filled with clear glass, but as new artists began to introduce designs in the 19th century, the use of new materials, including stained glass, transformed the abbey's aesthetic. The 13th-century windows were primarily made from clear glass. However, during the English Civil War and the Blitz, the abbey replaced this with new stained glass, primarily designed by artists like Ninian Comper and Hugh Easton and Alan Younger. This replacement was driven by the need to survive the conflict and the demand for new artistic expressions.
The changes in materials were directly linked to the major historical events that shaped the abbey's history.

He was moved into the Jerusalem Chamber, and died shortly afterwards. Edward V was born in the abbot\'s house in 1470.\n\nThe first jubilee celebration held at the abbey was for Queen Victoria\'s Golden Jubilee in 1887. Rather than wearing the full regalia that she had worn at her coronation, she wore her black mourning clothes topped with the insignia of the Order of the Garter and a miniature crown. She sat in the Coronation Chair—which received a coat of dark varnish for the occasion, which was painstakingly removed afterwards—making her the only monarch to sit in the chair twice. Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, marked their silver, gold, and diamond wedding anniversaries with services at the abbey and regularly attended annual observances there for Commonwealth Day.\nThe monarch participates in the Office of the Royal Maundy on Maundy Thursday each year, during which selected elderly people (as many people of each sex as the monarch has years of their life) receive alms of coins. The service has been held at churches around the country since 1952, returning to the abbey every 10 years.\n\n\n=== Coronations ===\n\nSince the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066, 40 English and British monarchs have been crowned in Westminster Abbey (not counting Edward V, Lady Jane Grey, and Edward VIII, who were never crowned). In 1216, Henry III could not be crowned in the abbey because London was occupied by hostile forces at the time. Henry was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral, and had a second coronation at Westminster Abbey in 1220. When he had the abbey rebuilt, it was designed with long transepts to accommodate many guests at future coronations. Much of the order of service derives from the Liber Regalis, an illuminated manuscript made in 1377 for the coronation of Richard II and held in the abbey\'s collections. On 6 May 2023, the coronation of Charles III took place at the abbey. The area used in the church is the crossing, known in the abbey as ""the theatre"" because of its suitability for grand events. The space in the crossing is clear rather than filled with immovable pews (like many similar churches), allowing for temporary seating in the transepts.\n\nThe Coronation Chair (the throne on which English and British sovereigns are seated when they are crowned) is in the abbey\'s St George\'s Chapel near the west door, and has been used at coronations since the 14th century. From 1301 to 1996 (except for a short time in 1950, when the stone was stolen by Scottish nationalists), the chair housed the Stone of Scone upon which the kings of Scots were crowned. Although it has been kept in Scotland at Edinburgh Castle since 1996, the stone is returned to the Coronation Chair in the abbey as needed for coronations. The chair was accessible to the public during the 18th and 19th centuries; people could sit in it, and some carved initials into the woodwork.\nBefore the 17th century, a king would hold a separate coronation for his new queen if he married after his coronation. The last of these to take place in the abbey was the coronation of Anne Boleyn in 1533, after her marriage to Henry VIII. Fifteen coronations of queens consort have been held in the abbey. A coronation for Jane Seymour, Henry VIII\'s third wife, was planned but she died before it took place; no coronations were planned for Henry\'s subsequent wives. Mary I\'s husband, Philip of Spain, was not given a separate coronation due to concerns that he would attempt to rule alone after Mary\'s death. Since then, there have been few opportunities for a second coronation; monarchs have generally come to the throne already married.\nHenry II held a coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey in 1170 for his son, known as Henry the Young King, while Henry II was still alive in an attempt to secure the succession. However, the Young King died before his father and never took the throne.']","
The abbey has strong connections with the royal family. It has been patronised by monarchs, been the location for coronations, royal weddings and funerals, and several monarchs have attended services there.

805,"What are the main functions of Westminster Abbey, as highlighted in the provided text?","[""=== Weddings ===\nAt least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey. Royal weddings at the abbey were relatively rare before the 20th century, with royals often married in a Chapel Royal or at Windsor Castle; this changed with the 1922 wedding of Princess Mary at the abbey. In 1923, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon became the first royal bride to leave her bouquet on the grave of the Unknown Warrior, a practice continued by many royal brides since.\n\nRoyal weddings have included:\n\n\n=== Funerals ===\nMany royal funerals took place at the abbey between that of Edward the Confessor in 1066 and that of Prince Henry, the last royal buried in the church, in 1790. There were no royal funerals at the abbey from then until that of Queen Alexandra in 1925; the queen was buried in Windsor Castle. Other queen consorts, such as Mary of Teck in 1953 and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002, have also had funerals at the abbey before being buried elsewhere.\nOn 6 September 1997, the ceremonial funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales was held at the abbey. Before the funeral, the railings of the abbey were swamped with flowers and tributes. The event was more widely seen than any previous occasion in the abbey's history, with 2 billion television viewers worldwide. Diana was buried privately on a private island at Althorp, her family estate.\nOn 19 September 2022, the state funeral of Elizabeth II took place at the abbey before her burial at St George's Chapel, Windsor. It was the first funeral of a monarch at Westminster Abbey for more than 260 years.\n\n\n== People ==\n\n\n=== Dean and Chapter ===\n\nWestminster Abbey is a collegiate church governed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster as established by a royal charter from Elizabeth I dated 21 May 1560, which created it as the Collegiate Church of St Peter Westminster (a royal peculiar). In 2019, David Hoyle was appointed Dean of Westminster. The chapter consists of four canons and a senior administrative officer, known as the Receiver General. One of the canons is also rector of the adjoining St Margaret's Church, Westminster, and is often the chaplain of the Speaker of the House of Commons. In addition to the dean and canons, there are minor canons.\n\n\n=== King's almsmen ===\nSix King's (or Queen's) almsmen and women are supported by the abbey. They are appointed by royal warrant on the recommendation of the dean and the Home Secretary, attend Matins and Evensong on Sundays, and perform requested duties for a small stipend. On duty, they wear a distinctive red gown with a crowned rose badge on the left shoulder.\nThe almshouse was founded near the abbey by Henry VII in 1502, and the twelve almsmen and three almswomen were originally minor court officials who were retired due to age or disability. They were required to be over the age of 50, single, with a good reputation, literate, able to look after themselves, and with an income of under £4 per year. The building survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but was demolished for road-widening in 1779. From the late 18th to the late 20th century, almsmen were usually old soldiers and sailors; today, they are primarily retired abbey employees.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\n\nWestminster School is in the abbey. Instruction has taken place since the 14th century with the monks of the abbey; the school regards its founder as Elizabeth I, who dissolved the monastery for the last time and provided for the establishment of the school, the dean, canons, assistant clergy, and lay officers. The schoolboys were rambunctious; Westminster boys have defaced the Coronation Chair, disrupted services, and once interrupted the consecration of four bishops with a bare-knuckle fight in the cloisters. One schoolboy carved on the Coronation Chair that he had slept in it overnight, making him probably its longest inhabitant. Westminster School became independent of the abbey Dean and Chapter in 1868, although the institutions remain closely connected. Westminster Abbey Choir School, also on the abbey grounds, educates the choirboys who sing for abbey services.""]","

The university played a crucial role in Edinburgh becoming a leading intellectual centre during the Scottish Enlightenment and contributed to the city being nicknamed the ""Athens of the North"".\nThe three main global university rankings (ARWU, THE, and QS) place the University of Edinburgh within their respective top 40. It is a member of several associations of research-intensive universities, including the Coimbra Group, League of European Research Universities, Russell Group, Una Europa, and Universitas 21. In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2024, the university had a total income of £1.386 billion, with £365.2 million from research grants and contracts. It has the third-largest endowment in the UK, behind only Cambridge and Oxford.

807,=== History ===,"['== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nIn 1557, Bishop Robert Reid of St Magnus Cathedral on Orkney made a will containing an endowment of 8,000 merks to build a college in Edinburgh. Unusually for his time, Reid\'s vision included the teaching of rhetoric and poetry, alongside more traditional subjects such as philosophy. However, the bequest was delayed by more than 25 years due to the religious revolution that led to the Reformation Parliament of 1560. The plans were revived in the late 1570s through efforts by the Edinburgh Town Council, first minister of Edinburgh James Lawson, and Lord Provost William Little. When Reid\'s descendants were unwilling to pay out the sum, the town council petitioned King James VI and his Privy Council. The King brokered a monetary compromise and granted a royal charter on 14 April 1582, empowering the town council to create a college of higher education. A college established by secular authorities was unprecedented in newly Presbyterian Scotland, as all previous Scottish universities had been founded through papal bulls.\n\nNamed Tounis College (Town\'s College), the university opened its doors to students on 14 October 1583, with an attendance of 80–90. At the time, the college mainly covered liberal arts and divinity. Instruction began under the charge of a graduate from the University of St Andrews, theologian Robert Rollock, who first served as Regent, and from 1586 as principal of the college. Initially Rollock was the sole instructor for first-year students, and he was expected to tutor the 1583 intake for all four years of their degree in every subject. The first cohort finished their studies in 1587, and 47 students graduated (or \'laureated\') with an M.A. degree. When King James VI visited Scotland in 1617, he held a disputation with the college\'s professors, after which he decreed that it should henceforth be called the ""Colledge [sic] of King James"". The university was known as both Tounis College and King James\' College until it gradually assumed the name of the University of Edinburgh during the 17th century.\nAfter the deposition of King James II and VII during the Glorious Revolution in 1688, the Parliament of Scotland passed legislation designed to root out Jacobite sympathisers amongst university staff. In Edinburgh, this led to the dismissal of Principal Alexander Monro and several professors and regents after a government visitation in 1690. The university was subsequently led by Principal Gilbert Rule, one of the inquisitors on the visitation committee.\n\n\n=== 18th and 19th century ===\n\nThe late 17th and early 18th centuries were marked by a power struggle between the university and town council, which had ultimate authority over staff appointments, curricula, and examinations. After a series of challenges by the university, the conflict culminated in the council seizing the college records in 1704. Relations were only gradually repaired over the next 150 years and suffered repeated setbacks.\nIn 1708 the Principal William Carsatres restructured the University, abolishing the regenting system and establishing a Dutch style system of Professors. The newly created Chairs, such as that of Greek and Humanity, were offered to the existing Regents. The university expanded by founding a Faculty of Law in 1707, a Faculty of Arts in 1708, and a Faculty of Medicine in 1726. In 1762, Reverend Hugh Blair was appointed by King George III as the first Regius Professor of Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres. This formalised literature as a subject and marks the foundation of the English Literature department, making Edinburgh the oldest centre of literary education in Britain.\nDuring the 18th century, the university was at the centre of the Scottish Enlightenment. The ideas of the Age of Enlightenment fell on especially fertile ground in Edinburgh because of the university\'s democratic and secular origin; its organization as a single entity instead of loosely connected colleges, which encouraged academic exchange; its adoption of the more flexible Dutch model of professorship, rather than having student cohorts taught by a single regent; and the lack of land endowments as its source of income, which meant its faculty operated in a more competitive environment. Between 1750 and 1800, this system produced and attracted key Enlightenment figures such as chemist Joseph Black, economist Adam Smith, historian William Robertson, philosophers David Hume and Dugald Stewart, physician William Cullen, and early sociologist Adam Ferguson, many of which taught concurrently. By the time the Royal Society of Edinburgh was founded in 1783, the university was regarded as one of the world\'s preeminent scientific institutions, and Voltaire called Edinburgh a ""hotbed of genius"" as a result.']","

The establishment of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783 played a crucial role in the development of scientific institutions like Edinburgh University. It provided a platform for key Enlightenment figures like Joseph Black, Adam Smith, William Robertson, David Hume, and Dugald Stewart to interact and collaborate. The Royal Society's reputation for intellectual rigor and its emphasis on empirical observation fostered a culture of scientific inquiry and research within the university. Furthermore, the Royal Society's position as a leading scientific institution helped attract students and scholars to Edinburgh, thereby contributing to the university's growth as a center for scientific learning.

In 1919, the university bought the land of West Mains Farm in the south of the city for the development of a new satellite campus specialising in the sciences. On 6 July 1920, King George V laid the foundation of the first new building (now called the Joseph Black Building), housing the Department of Chemistry. The campus was named King's Buildings in honour of George V.\n\nNew College on The Mound was originally opened in 1846 as a Free Church of Scotland college, later of the United Free Church of Scotland. Since the 1930s it has been the home of the School of Divinity. Prior to the 1929 reunion of the Church of Scotland, candidates for the ministry in the United Free Church studied at New College, whilst candidates for the Church of Scotland studied in the university's Faculty of Divinity. In 1935 the two institutions merged, with all operations moved to the New College site in Old Town. This freed up Old College for Edinburgh Law School.\n\nThe Polish School of Medicine was established in 1941 as a wartime academic initiative. While it was originally intended for students and doctors in the Polish Armed Forces in the West, civilians were also allowed to take the courses, which were taught in Polish and awarded Polish medical degrees. When the school was closed in 1949, 336 students had matriculated, of which 227 students graduated with the equivalent of an MBChB and a total of 19 doctors obtained a doctorate or MD. A bronze plaque commemorating the Polish School of Medicine is located in the Quadrangle of the old Medical School in Teviot Place.\nOn 10 May 1951, the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College, founded in 1823 by William Dick, was reconstituted as the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and officially became part of the university. It achieved full faculty status as Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1964.\nIn 1955 the university opened the first department of nursing in Europe for academic study. This department was inspired by the work of Gladys Beaumont Carter and a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.\nBy the end of the 1950s, there were around 7,000 students matriculating annually, more than doubling the numbers from the turn of the century. The university addressed this partially through the redevelopment of George Square, demolishing much of the area's historic houses and erecting modern buildings such as 40 George Square, Appleton Tower and the Main Library.\nOn 1 August 1998, the Moray House Institute of Education, founded in 1848, merged with the University of Edinburgh, becoming its Faculty of Education. Following the internal restructuring of the university in 2002, Moray House became known as the Moray House School of Education. It was renamed the Moray House School of Education and Sport in August 2019.""]","
The Edinburgh University Students' Association (EUSA) is a significant historical institution with a long and complex past. It began in 1973 as a merger of the SRC, EUU, and Chambers Street Union.  During World War I, EUSA played a vital role in supporting students and their campuses. Subsequent events included the establishment of the Joseph Black Building in 1920, the development of the New College satellite campus in 1935, and the merging of the Polish School of Medicine in 1949. Through its role in wartime support and later in addressing the needs of students in the 20th century, the EUSA has become a crucial part of Edinburgh University's history and continues to evolve to this day.

In August 2010, author J. K. Rowling provided £10 million in funding to create the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, which was officially opened in October 2013. The Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM) is a stem cell research centre dedicated to the development of regenerative treatments, which was opened in 2012. CRM is also home to applied scientists working with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) and Roslin Cells.\n\nIn December 2002, the Edinburgh Cowgate fire destroyed a number of university buildings, including some 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) of the School of Informatics at 80 South Bridge. This was replaced with the Informatics Forum on Bristo Square, completed in July 2008. Also in 2002, the Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre (ECRC) was opened on the Western General Hospital site. In 2007, the MRC Human Genetics Unit formed a partnership with the Centre for Genomic & Experimental Medicine and the ECRC to create the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine (renamed the Institute of Genetics and Cancer in 2021) on the same site.\nIn April 2008, the Roslin Institute – an animal sciences research centre known for cloning Dolly the sheep – became part of the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies. In 2011, the school moved into a new £60 million building on the Easter Bush campus, which now houses research and teaching facilities, and a hospital for small and farm animals.\n\nEdinburgh College of Art, founded in 1760, formally merged with the university's School of Arts, Culture and Environment on 1 August 2011. In 2014, the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute (ZJE) was founded as an international joint institute offering degrees in biomedical sciences, taught in English. The campus, located in Haining, Zhejiang Province, China, was established on 15 March 2016.\nThe university began hosting a Wikimedian in Residence in 2016. The residency was made into a full-time position in 2019, with the Wikimedian involved in teaching and learning activities within the scope of the University of Edinburgh WikiProject.\nIn 2018, the University of Edinburgh was a signatory to the £1.3 billion Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal, in partnership with the UK and Scottish governments, six local authorities and all universities and colleges in the region. The university committed to delivering a range of economic benefits to the region through the Data-Driven Innovation initiative. In conjunction with Heriot-Watt University, the deal created five innovation hubs: the Bayes Centre, Edinburgh Futures Institute, Usher Institute, Easter Bush, and one further hub based at Heriot-Watt, the National Robotarium. The deal also included creation of the Edinburgh International Data Facility, which performs high-speed data processing in a secure environment.\nIn September 2020, the university completed work on the Richard Verney Health Centre at its central area campus on Bristo Square. The facility houses a health centre and pharmacy, and the university's disability and counselling services. The university's largest expansion in the 2020s was the conversion of some of the historic Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place, which had been vacated in 2003 and partially developed into the Quartermile. The £120 million project created a home for the Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI), an interdisciplinary hub linking arts, humanities, and social sciences with other disciplines in the research and teaching of complex, multi-stakeholder societal challenges. The EFI officially opened its doors to the public on 4 June 2024.""]","
The purpose of the BioQuarter project was to create a modern hospital and medical campus in the Little France area of Edinburgh.

Based on the provided historical links, alumni of Edinburgh medical schools founded numerous institutions, primarily in the fields of medicine, nursing, and related sciences. These institutions were established to provide accessible and affordable medical education to a wider population, regardless of social class or religious affiliation. The creation of these medical schools and associated institutions was a direct response to a need for broader healthcare access and to develop a professional medical workforce. Edinburgh's medical school's graduates played a crucial role in establishing and growing numerous other institutions across the globe, particularly in Canada, the United States, and Australia, significantly impacting the development of healthcare systems in those regions.

815,Holyrood ====,"[""==== Holyrood ====\n\nThe Holyrood campus, just off the Royal Mile, used to be the site for Moray House Institute for Education until it merged with the university on 1 August 1998. The university has since extended this campus. The buildings include redeveloped and extended Sports Science, Physical Education and Leisure Management facilities at St Leonard's Land linked to the Sports Institute in the Pleasance. The £80 million O'Shea Hall at Holyrood was named after the former principal of the university Sir Timothy O'Shea and was opened by Princess Anne in 2017, providing a living and social environment for postgraduate students. The Outreach Centre, Institute for Academic Development (University Services Group), and Edinburgh Centre for Professional Legal Studies are also located at Holyrood.\n\n\n=== King's Buildings ===\n\nThe King's Buildings campus is located in the south of the city. Most of the Science and Engineering College's research and teaching activities take place at the campus, which occupies a 35-hectare site. It includes the Alexander Graham Bell Building (for mobile phones and digital communications systems), James Clerk Maxwell Building (the administrative and teaching centre of the School of Physics and Astronomy and School of Mathematics), Joseph Black Building (home to the School of Chemistry), Royal Observatory, Swann Building (the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology), Waddington Building (the Centre for Systems Biology at Edinburgh), William Rankine Building (School of Engineering's Institute for Infrastructure and Environment), and others. Until 2012, the KB campus was served by three libraries: Darwin Library, James Clerk Maxwell Library, and Robertson Engineering and Science Library. These were replaced by the Noreen and Kenneth Murray Library opened for the academic year 2012/13. The campus also hosts the National e-Science Centre (NeSC), Scotland's Rural College (SRUC), Scottish Institute for Enterprise (SIE), Scottish Microelectronics Centre (SMC), and Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC).\n\n\n=== BioQuarter ===\n\nThe BioQuarter campus, based in the Little France area, is home to the majority of medical facilities of the university, alongside the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. The campus houses the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Chancellor's Building, Euan MacDonald Centre, and Queen's Medical Research Institute, which opened in 2005. The Chancellor's Building has two large lecture theatres and a medical library connected to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by a series of corridors.\n\n\n=== Easter Bush ===\nThe Easter Bush campus, located seven miles south of the city, houses the Jeanne Marchig International Centre for Animal Welfare Education, Roslin Institute, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, and Veterinary Oncology and Imaging Centre.\nThe Roslin Institute is an animal sciences research institute which is sponsored by BBSRC. The Institute won international fame in 1996, when its researchers Sir Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell and their colleagues created Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell. A year later Polly and Molly were cloned, both sheep contained a human gene.\n\n\n=== Western General ===\nThe Western General campus, in proximity to the Western General Hospital, contains the Biomedical Research Facility, Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility, and Institute of Genetics and Cancer (formerly the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine).\n\n\tModern architecture at the University of Edinburgh\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Organisation and administration ==\n\n\n=== Governance ===\n\nIn common with the other ancient universities of Scotland, and in contrast to nearly all other pre-1992 universities which are established by royal charters, the University of Edinburgh is constituted by the Universities (Scotland) Acts 1858 to 1966. These acts provide for three major bodies in the governance of the university: the University Court, the General Council, and the Senatus Academicus.\n\n\n==== University Court ====\nThe University Court is the university's governing body and the legal person of the university, chaired by the rector and consisting of the principal, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and of Assessors appointed by the rector, chancellor, Edinburgh Town Council, General Council, and Senatus Academicus. By the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889, it is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. All property belonging to the university at the passing of the Act was vested in the Court. The present powers of the Court are further defined in the Universities (Scotland) Act 1966, including the administration and management of the university's revenue and property, the regulation of staff salaries, and the establishment and composition of committees of its own members or others.""]","

The Holyrood campus is currently housed within the University of Edinburgh. It was formerly the site of Moray House Institute for Education, but has since merged with the university on 1 August 1998. It is located off the Royal Mile and is home to the Sports Science, Physical Education, and Leisure Management facilities, which are linked to the Sports Institute in the Pleasance.

816,What is the primary function of the Senate Academicus and who is generally responsible for its leadership?,"[""==== General Council ====\nThe General Council consists of graduates, academic staff, current and former University Court members. It was established to ensure that graduates have a continuing voice in the management of the university. The Council is required to meet twice per year to consider matters affecting the wellbeing and prosperity of the university. The Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 gave the Council the power to consider draft ordinances and resolutions, to be presented with an annual report of the work and activities of the university, and to receive an audited financial statement. The Council elects the chancellor of the university and three Assessors on the University Court.\n\n\n==== Senatus Academicus ====\nThe Senatus Academicus is the university's supreme academic body, chaired by the principal and consisting of the professors, heads of departments, and a number of readers, lecturers and other teaching and research staff. The core function of the Senatus is to regulate and supervise the teaching and discipline of the university and to promote research. The Senatus elects four Assessors on the University Court. The Senatus meets three times per year, hosting a presentation and discussion session which is open to all members of staff at each meeting.\n\n\n==== University officials ====\n\nThe university's three most significant officials are its chancellor, rector, and principal, whose rights and responsibilities are largely derived from the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.\nThe office of chancellor serves as the titular head and highest office of the university. Their duties include conferring degrees and enhancing the profile and reputation of the university on national and global levels. The chancellor is elected by the university's General Council, and a person generally remains in the office for life. Previous chancellors include former prime minister Arthur Balfour and novelist Sir J. M. Barrie. Princess Anne has held the position since March 2011 succeeding Prince Philip. She is also Patron of the university's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.\nThe principal is responsible for the overall operation of the university in a chief executive role. The principal is formally nominated by the Curators of Patronage and appointed by the University Court. They are the President of the Senatus Academicus and a member of the University Court ex officio. The principal is also automatically appointed vice-chancellor, in which role they confer degrees on behalf of the chancellor. Previous principals include physicist Sir Edward Appleton and religious philosopher Stewart Sutherland. The current principal is nephrologist Sir Peter Mathieson, who has held the position since February 2018.\nThe office of rector is elected every three years by the staff and matriculated students. The primary role of the rector is to preside at the University Court. The rector also chairs meetings of the General Council in absence of the chancellor. They work closely with students and Edinburgh University Students' Association. Previous rectors include microbiologist Sir Alexander Fleming, and former Prime Ministers Sir Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George. The current rector is activist and writer Simon Fanshawe, who has held the position since March 2024.\n\n\n=== Colleges and schools ===\nIn 2002, the university was reorganised from its nine faculties into three 'Colleges'. While technically not a collegiate university, it comprises the Colleges of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (CAHSS), Science & Engineering (CSE) and Medicine & Vet Medicine (CMVM). Within these colleges are 'Schools', which either represent one academic discipline such as Informatics or assemble adjacent academic disciplines such as the School of History, Classics and Archaeology. While bound by College-level policies, individual Schools can differ in their organisation and governance. As of 2021, the university has 21 schools in total.\n\n\n==== Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences ====\n\nThe College took on its current name of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences in 2016 after absorbing the Edinburgh College of Art in 2011. CAHSS offers more than 280 undergraduate degree programmes, 230 taught postgraduate programmes, and 200 research postgraduate programmes. Twenty subjects offered by the college were ranked within the top 10 nationally in the 2022 Complete University Guide. It includes the oldest English Literature department in Britain, which was ranked 7th globally in the 2021 QS Rankings by Subject in English Language & Literature. The college hosts Scotland's ESRC Doctoral Training Centre (DTC), the Scottish Graduate School of Social Science. The college is the largest of the three colleges by enrolment, with 26,130 students and 3,089 academic staff.""]","
The primary function of the Senatus Academicus is to regulate and supervise the teaching and discipline of the university and to promote research. 
Generally, the leadership of the Senatus Academicus is held by the principal. The principal is formally nominated by the Curators of Patronage and appointed by the University Court.

817,I have been asked to set up 3 questions for an upcoming quiz/examination.,"['==== Medicine and Veterinary Medicine ====\n\nEdinburgh Medical School was widely considered the best medical school in the English-speaking world throughout the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century and contributed significantly to the university\'s international reputation. Its graduates founded medical schools all over the world, including at five of the seven Ivy League universities (Columbia, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania, and Yale); those in McGill, Montréal, Sydney, and Vermont; the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (now part of Imperial College London), Middlesex Hospital, and the London School of Medicine for Women (both now part of UCL).\nIn the 21st century, the medical school has continued to excel, and it is associated with 13 Nobel Prize recipients: seven recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and six of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 2021, it was ranked third in the UK by The Times University Guide, and the Complete University Guide. In 2022, it was ranked the UK\'s best medical school by the Guardian University Guide,  It also ranked 21st in the world by both the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and the QS World University Rankings in 2021.\nThe Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies is a world leader in veterinary education, research and practice. The eight original faculties formed four Faculty Groups in August 1992. Medicine and Veterinary Medicine became one of these, and in 2002 became the smallest of the three colleges, with 7,740 students and 1,896 academic staff. The university\'s teaching hospitals include the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, St John\'s Hospital, Livingston, Roodlands Hospital, and Royal Hospital for Children and Young People.\n\n\n==== Science and Engineering ====\n\nIn the 16th century, science was taught as ""natural philosophy"" in the university. The 17th century saw the institution of the University Chairs of Mathematics and Botany, followed the next century by Chairs of Natural History, Astronomy, Chemistry and Agriculture. It was Edinburgh\'s professors who took a leading part in the formation of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. Joseph Black, Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the time, founded the world\'s first Chemical Society in 1785. The first named degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Science was instituted in 1864, and a separate Faculty of Science was created in 1893 after three centuries of scientific advances at Edinburgh. The Regius Chair in Engineering was established in 1868, and the Regius Chair in Geology in 1871. In 1991 the Faculty of Science was renamed the Faculty of Science and Engineering, and in 2002 it became the College of Science and Engineering. The college has 11,745 students and 2,937 academic staff.\n\n\n==== Sub-units, centres and institutes ====\n\nSome subunits, centres and institutes within the university are listed as follows:\n\n\n=== Finances ===\nIn the financial year ending 31 July 2024, the University of Edinburgh had a total income of £1.386 billion (2022/23 – £1.341 billion) and total expenditure of £1.014 billion (2022/23 – £1.181 billion).

818,Here are the questions I have generated:,"['==== Medicine and Veterinary Medicine ====\n\nEdinburgh Medical School was widely considered the best medical school in the English-speaking world throughout the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century and contributed significantly to the university\'s international reputation. Its graduates founded medical schools all over the world, including at five of the seven Ivy League universities (Columbia, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania, and Yale); those in McGill, Montréal, Sydney, and Vermont; the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (now part of Imperial College London), Middlesex Hospital, and the London School of Medicine for Women (both now part of UCL).\nIn the 21st century, the medical school has continued to excel, and it is associated with 13 Nobel Prize recipients: seven recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and six of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 2021, it was ranked third in the UK by The Times University Guide, and the Complete University Guide. In 2022, it was ranked the UK\'s best medical school by the Guardian University Guide,  It also ranked 21st in the world by both the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and the QS World University Rankings in 2021.\nThe Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies is a world leader in veterinary education, research and practice. The eight original faculties formed four Faculty Groups in August 1992. Medicine and Veterinary Medicine became one of these, and in 2002 became the smallest of the three colleges, with 7,740 students and 1,896 academic staff. The university\'s teaching hospitals include the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, St John\'s Hospital, Livingston, Roodlands Hospital, and Royal Hospital for Children and Young People.\n\n\n==== Science and Engineering ====\n\nIn the 16th century, science was taught as ""natural philosophy"" in the university. The 17th century saw the institution of the University Chairs of Mathematics and Botany, followed the next century by Chairs of Natural History, Astronomy, Chemistry and Agriculture. It was Edinburgh\'s professors who took a leading part in the formation of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. Joseph Black, Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the time, founded the world\'s first Chemical Society in 1785. The first named degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Science was instituted in 1864, and a separate Faculty of Science was created in 1893 after three centuries of scientific advances at Edinburgh. The Regius Chair in Engineering was established in 1868, and the Regius Chair in Geology in 1871. In 1991 the Faculty of Science was renamed the Faculty of Science and Engineering, and in 2002 it became the College of Science and Engineering. The college has 11,745 students and 2,937 academic staff.\n\n\n==== Sub-units, centres and institutes ====\n\nSome subunits, centres and institutes within the university are listed as follows:\n\n\n=== Finances ===\nIn the financial year ending 31 July 2024, the University of Edinburgh had a total income of £1.386 billion (2022/23 – £1.341 billion) and total expenditure of £1.014 billion (2022/23 – £1.181 billion). Key sources of income included £527.2 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 – £513.7 million), £208.7 million from funding body grants (2022/23 – £210.9 million), £365.2 million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 – £339.5 million), £62.7 million from investment income (2022/23 – £42.2 million) and £25 million from donations and endowments (2022/23 – £55.7 million).\nAt year end, Edinburgh had endowments of £580.4 million (2023 – £559.8 million) and total net assets of £3.003 billion (2023 – £2.615 billion). It holds the third-largest endowment of any university in the UK.\n\n\n=== Staff, community and networking ===\nIn June 2024, the University employed over 12,390 full time equivalent staff, an increase of 508 over the previous year:\n\nAs part of the university\'s support for researchers, each College has Research Staff Societies that include postdoc societies, and organisations specific to each school. Cross-curricula Research Networks bring together researchers working on similar topics.\n\nIndependently of the College hierarchy, aligned with the university\'s EDI policy, eight Staff Networks bring together and represent diverse staff groups:\n\nDisabled Staff Network\nStaff BAME Network\nEdinburgh Race Equality Network\nJewish Staff Network\nStaff Pride Network\nUniversity & College Unions incorporating the national academic union and the in-house Edinburgh University Union\nLong-term Research Staff Network\nSupport for Technicians and Steering Committee']","1.

819,Which of the following statements best describes the university's relationship with the surrounding area and its international collaborations?,"['==== Industrial action ====\nStaff at the university engaged in the sector-wide 2018–2023 UK higher education strikes called by the University and College Union over disputes regarding USS pensions, pay, and working conditions. A Marking and Assessment Boycott that commenced on 20 April 2023 was called off on 6 September 2023. However, the UCU voted to continue strike action throughout the rest of September.\nIn November 2024, Principal Mathieson warned staff of impending redundancies, citing ""a multi-million pound increase to our salary bill"" he said had been created by the Labour administration\'s National Insurance hike. Following Mathieson\'s announcement of £140 million in cuts on 25 February 2025, the UCU said that 59% of its members had turned out for a consulative ballot, with 75% willing to strike, and a further 10% prepared to work to rule including refusing to cover for absent colleagues. Mathieson\'s annual salary package exceeding £418,000 and comparable remunerations of other university executive staff also fell under heavy criticism in light of cuts staff were being asked to absorb.\n\n\n== Academic profile ==\nThe university is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, and the Sutton 13 group of top-ranked universities in the UK. It is the only British university to be a member of both the Coimbra Group and the League of European Research Universities, and it is a founding member of Una Europa and Universitas 21, both international associations of research-intensive universities. The university maintains historically strong ties with the neighbouring Heriot-Watt University for teaching and research. Edinburgh also offers a wide range of free online MOOC courses on three global platforms Coursera, Edx and FutureLearn.\n\n\n=== Admissions ===\n\nIn 2021, the University of Edinburgh had the seventh-highest average entry standards amongst universities in the UK, with new undergraduates averaging 197 UCAS points, equivalent to just above AAAA in A-level grades. It gave offers of admission to 33% of its 18 year old applicants in 2022, the fourth-lowest amongst the Russell Group.\nIn 2022, excluding courses within Edinburgh College of Art, the most competitive courses for Scottish applicants were Oral Health Science (9%), Business (11%), Philosophy & Psychology (14%), Social Work (15%), and International Business (15%). For students from the rest of the UK, the most competitive courses were Nursing (5%), Medicine (6%), Veterinary Medicine (6%), Psychology (8%), and Politics, Philosophy and Economics (10%). For international students, the most competitive courses were Medicine (5%), Nursing (7%), Business (11%), Politics, Philosophy and\nEconomics (12%), and Sociology (13%).\nFor the academic year 2019/20, 36.8% of Edinburgh\'s new undergraduates were privately educated, the second-highest proportion among mainstream British universities, behind only Oxford. As of August 2021, it has a higher proportion of female than male students with a male to female ratio of 38:62 in the undergraduate population, and the undergraduate student body is composed of 30% Scottish students, 32% from the rest of the UK, 10% from the EU, and 28% from outside the EU.\n\n\n=== Graduation ===\n\nAt graduation ceremonies, graduates are being \'capped\' with the Geneva bonnet, which involves the university\'s principal tapping them on the head with the cap while they receive their graduation certificate. The velvet-and-silk hat has been used for over 150 years, and legend says that it was originally made from cloth taken from the breeches of 16th-century scholars John Knox or George Buchanan. However, when the hat was last restored in the early 2000s, a label dated 1849 was discovered bearing the name of Edinburgh tailor Henry Banks, although some doubt remains whether he manufactured or restored the hat. In 2006, a university emblem that had been taken into space by astronaut and Edinburgh graduate Piers Sellers was incorporated into the Geneva bonnet.\n\n\n=== Library system ===\n\nPre-dating the university by three years, Edinburgh University Library was founded in 1580 through the donation of a large collection by Clement Litill, and today is the largest academic library collection in Scotland. The Brutalist style eight-storey Main Library building in George Square was designed by Sir Basil Spence. At the time of its completion in 1967, it was the largest building of its type in the UK, and today is a category A listed building. The library system also includes many specialised libraries at the college and school level.']","

The university's reputation plays a significant role in its success. Several factors contribute to this, including:
*   **Ranking in National and International Rankings:** Edinburgh’s consistently high rankings (particularly the 2021 Aggregate Ranking, THE Global Employability University Ranking, ARWU, QS, and the U.S. News & World Report rankings) demonstrate its strong position within the global university landscape.
*   **Research Output:** A strong reputation is reflected in its research output, evident through its 'world leading' designation, its 90% of research activity being 'world leading' or 'internationally excellent', the high number of publications and citations, and its robust ranking in the 2021 Aggregate Ranking.
*   **Student Satisfaction:** Edinburgh’s ranking of last in the UK for teaching quality, coupled with the 2015 Good University Guide, points to issues requiring improvement.  However, despite this, its overall student satisfaction (as evidenced by the 2022 Complete University Guide) suggests a generally positive experience, and that this is improving.

The society is indirectly associated with the university through the students union as an unincorporated society.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\nAmateur dramatic societies benefit from Edinburgh being an important cultural hub for comedy, amateur and fringe theatre throughout the UK, most prominently through the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nThe Edinburgh University Music Society (EUMS) is a student-run musical organisation, which is Scotland\'s oldest student\'s musical society; it can be traced back to a concert in February 1867. It performs three concert series throughout the year whilst also undertaking a programme of charity events and education projects.\n\nThe Edinburgh University Theatre Company (EUTC), founded in 1890 as the Edinburgh University Drama Society, is known for running Bedlam Theatre, the oldest student-run theatre in Britain and venue for the Fringe. EUTC also funds acclaimed improvisational comedy troupe The Improverts during term time and the Fringe. Alumni include Sir Michael Boyd, Ian Charleson, Kevin McKidd, and Greg Wise.\nThe Edinburgh Studio Opera (formerly Edinburgh University Opera Club) is a student opera company in Edinburgh. It performs at least one fully staged opera each year. The Edinburgh University Savoy Opera Group (EUSOG) is an opera and musical theatre company founded by students in 1961 to promote and perform the comic operettas of Sir William Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan, collectively known as Savoy Operas after the theatre in which they were originally staged.\nThe Edinburgh University Footlights are a musical theatre company founded in 1989 and produce two large scale shows a year. One of the founders is the Theatre Producer Colin Ingram. Theatre Parodok, founded in 2004, is a student theatre company that aims to produce shows that are ""experimental without being exclusive"". They stage one large show each semester and one for the festival.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nThe Student is a fortnightly student newspaper. Founded in 1887 by writer Robert Louis Stevenson, it is the oldest student newspaper in the United Kingdom. Former writers of the newspaper include politicians Gordon Brown, Robin Cook, and Lord Steel of Aikwood. It has been independent of the university since 1992, but was forced to temporarily fold in 2002 due to increasing debts. The newspaper won a number of student newspaper awards in the years following its relaunch.\nThe Journal was an independent publication, established in 2007 by three students and former writers for The Student. It was also distributed to other higher education institutions in the city, such as Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh Napier University, and Telford College. It was the largest such publication in Scotland, with a print run of 10,000 copies. Despite winning a number of awards for its journalism, the magazine folded in 2015 due to financial difficulties.\nFreshAir, launched on 3 October 1992, is an alternative music student radio station. The station is one of the oldest surviving student radio stations in the UK, and won the ""Student Radio Station of the Year"" award at the annual Student Radio Awards in 2004.\nIn September 2015, the Edinburgh University Student Television (EUTV) became the newest addition to the student media scene at the university, producing a regular magazine-style programme, documentaries and other special events.']","

Edinburgh is also Challenger\'s alma mater in the books.\nDr. Fu Manchu, a fictional supervillain created by Sax Rohmer in 1912, stated that ""I am a doctor of philosophy from Edinburgh, a doctor of law from Christ\'s College, a doctor of medicine from Harvard. My friends, out of courtesy, call me \'Doctor\'."" In 2010, Fu Manchu\'s connections with the University where he supposedly obtained a doctorate were investigated in a mockumentary by Miles Jupp (also an Edinburgh alumnus) for BBC Radio 4.\nIn the movie Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959), an adaptation of Jules Verne\'s novel of the same name, the protagonist Sir Oliver Lindenbrook is a Professor of Geology at the university. An early scene where Lindenbrook addresses the students is filmed at the central quadrangle of Old College.\nThe historical film Chariots of Fire (1981) is based on the story of Olympic runner and Edinburgh graduate Eric Liddell, and includes scenes filmed outside of Assembly Hall, New College. Liddell is played by Ian Charleson, who is also an Edinburgh alumnus.\nIn the novel The Last King of Scotland (1998) by Giles Foden, the fictional protagonist Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is a medical doctor recently graduated from Edinburgh. The 2006 film of the same name stars James McAvoy in the role of Dr. Garrigan with the same background.\nIn the American television show NCIS (2003–present), the chief medical examiner, Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard studied medicine at Edinburgh. Ari Haswari, the show\'s main antagonist for the first two seasons, also studied medicine at Edinburgh.\nIn the novel One Day (2009), the lead characters Dexter and Emma both graduated from Edinburgh. A feature film based on the book, also titled One Day and starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess was released in August 2011, with some scenes filmed at the university. A Netflix adaptation of the movie started production in 2021, with filming occurring in the grounds of Old College in 2022.\nThe BBC legal drama Garrow\'s Law (2009–2011) was largely filmed in Edinburgh, despite being set in London. Old College and the Playfair Library are prominently featured.\nThe thriller television series Clique (2017–2019) produced by BBC Three focuses on two students at the university.

Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote to him: ""When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep out of my head but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviour\'s farewell discourse to his disciples which begins at the end of the 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don\'t wish you to give me your opinion about it.""\nDarwin had already wondered about the materialism implied by his ideas. The letter shows Emma\'s tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Emma cherished a belief in the afterlife, and was concerned that they should ""belong to each other"" for eternity. The passage in the Gospel of John referred to in Emma\'s letter says ""Love one another"" (13:34), then describes Jesus  saying ""I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"" (14:6). Desmond and Moore note that the section continues: ""Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned"" (15:6). As disbelief later gradually crept over Darwin, he could ""hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine.""\nFollowing their marriage in January 1839, they shared discussions about Christianity for many years. They socialised with the Unitarian clergymen James Martineau and John James Tayler, and read their works as well as those of other Unitarian and liberal Anglican authors such as Francis William Newman whose Phases of faith described a spiritual journey from Calvinism to theism, all part of widespread and heated debate on the authority of Anglicanism. In Downe Emma attended the Anglican village church, but as a Unitarian had the family turn round in silence when the Trinitarian Nicene Creed was recited.\nSoon after their marriage, Emma wrote to Charles ""while you are acting conscientiously & sincerely wishing, & trying to learn the truth, you cannot be wrong"", and although concerned at the threat to faith of the ""habit in scientific pursuits of believing nothing till it is proved"", her hope that he did not ""consider his opinion as formed"" proved correct. Methodical conscientious doubt as a state of inquiry rather than disbelief made him open to nature and revelation, and they remained open with each other.']","
Emma's religious beliefs were rooted in Unitarianism, emphasizing inner feeling and questioning over the authority of religious texts or doctrine. Her views were not simple and unwavering, but a product of intensive study and questioning.
