They were married on 29 January 1839 and were the parents of ten children, seven of whom survived to adulthood.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nEmma Wedgwood was born at the family estate of Maer Hall in Maer, Staffordshire, the youngest of seven children of Josiah Wedgwood II and his wife Elizabeth ""Bessie"" (née Allen). Her grandfather Josiah Wedgwood had made his fortune in pottery, and like many others who were not part of the aristocracy, they were nonconformist, belonging to the Unitarian church. Charles Darwin was her first cousin; their shared grandparents were Josiah and Sarah Wedgwood, and as the Wedgwood and Darwin families were closely allied, they had been acquainted since childhood.\nShe was close to her sister Fanny, the two being known by the family as the ""Doveleys"", and was charming and messy, accounting for her nickname, ""Little Miss Slip-Slop"".:\u200a9\u200a She helped her older sister Elizabeth with the Sunday school which was held in Maer Hall laundry, writing simple moral tales to aid instruction and giving 60 village children their only formal training in reading, writing and religion.:\u200a17\u200a\nThe Wedgwoods visited Paris for six months in 1818. Though Emma was only 10 at the time, the strangeness and interest of arriving in France remained in her memory.\nIn January 1822 the 13-year-old Emma and her sister Fanny were taken by their mother for a year at Mrs Mayer\'s school at Greville House, on Paddington Green, London, at what was then the semi-rural village of Paddington. Emma was by then ""one of the show performers on the piano"", to the extent that on one occasion she was invited along to play for George IV\'s Mrs Fitzherbert. After this time, Emma was taught by her elder sisters as well as tutors in some subjects. For the rest of her life Emma continued to be a fine pianist, with a tendency to speed up slow movements. She had piano lessons from Moscheles, and allegedly ""two or three"" from Chopin.\nIn 1825 Josiah took his daughters on a grand tour of Europe, via Paris to near Geneva to visit their Aunt Jessie (Madame de Sismondi, née Allen, wife of the historian Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi) and then on.  In the following year the Sismondis visited Maer, then took Emma and her sister Fanny back to near Geneva to stay with them for eight months. When her father went to collect them he was accompanied by their cousin, Caroline Darwin, and also took Charles Darwin, Caroline\'s brother, as far as Paris, where they all met up again before returning home in July 1827. She was keen on outdoor sports and loved archery.:\u200a21\u200a\nAt Maer on 31 August 1831 she was with her family when they helped Charles Darwin to overturn his father\'s objections to letting Charles go on an extended voyage on the Beagle. During the voyage Charles\' sisters kept him informed of news including the death of Emma\'s sister Fanny at the age of 26, political developments and family gossip.\nEmma herself had turned down several offers of marriage, and after her mother suffered a seizure and became bedridden Emma and her older sister Elizabeth spent a lot of time nursing their mother, though with the help of many servants. Emma and Elizabeth took turns spending time away from their mother, and Emma spent several months each year away from home, staying with friends or family.:\u200a57–58']","

Emma's religious beliefs were initially formed on Unitarianism, emphasizing inner feeling over the authority of religious texts or doctrine. Her study and questioning were intense, leading to a deep understanding of the subject. However, as she engaged with Darwin, their views shifted. Initially, she held a belief in the afterlife, and was concerned that differences of belief would separate them.  Her views were influenced by the Gospel of John, which spoke of love and devotion, and the concept of ""Love one another.""  As Darwin’s skepticism emerged and the debate surrounding the materialism of his ideas intensified, she transitioned from a belief in the afterlife to agnosticism, acknowledging the potential consequences of disbelief. Her thoughts were also changed due to her concerns about how she could maintain open dialogue with Darwin, and how to avoid the perception that she was concealing her opinions.

The church has an eleven-bay nave with aisles, transepts, and a chancel with ambulatory and radiating chapels. The building is supported with two tiers of flying buttresses. The western end of the nave and the west front were designed by Henry Yevele in a Perpendicular Gothic style. The Henry VII Chapel was built in a late Perpendicular style in Huddlestone stone, probably by Robert and William Vertue. The west towers were designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor and blend the Gothic style of the abbey with the Baroque style fashionable during his lifetime.\nThe modern Westminster Abbey is largely based on French Gothic styles, especially those found at Reims Cathedral, rather than the contemporaneous English Gothic styles. For example, the English Gothic style favours large and elaborate towers, while Westminster Abbey did not have any towers until the 18th century. It is also more similar to French churches than English ones in terms of its ratio of height to width: Westminster Abbey has the highest nave of any Gothic church in England, and the nave is much narrower than any medieval English church of a similar height. Instead of a short, square, eastern end (as was the English fashion), Westminster Abbey has a long, rounded apse, and it also has chapels radiating from the ambulatory, which is typical of a French Gothic style. However, there are also distinctively English elements, such as the use of materials of contrasting colours, as with the Purbeck marble and white stone in the crossing.\nThe northern entrance has three porches, with the central one featuring an elaborately-carved tympanum, leading it to acquire the nickname ""Solomon\'s porch"" as a reference to the legendary temple in Jerusalem.\nThe abbey retains its 13th- and 14th-century cloisters, which would have been one of the busiest parts of the church when it was part of a monastery. The west cloister was used for the teaching of novice monks, the north for private study. The south cloister led to the refectory, and the east to the chapter house and dormitory. In the southwest corner of the cloisters is a cellarium formerly used by the monks to store food and wine; in modern times, it is the abbey café. The north cloister and northern end of the east cloister, closest to the church, are the oldest; they date to c.\u20091250, whereas the rest are from 1352 to 1366. The abbey also contains a Little Cloister, on the site of the monks\' infirmary. The Little Cloister dates from the end of the 17th century and contains a small garden with a fountain in the centre. A passageway from the Little Cloister leads to College Garden, which has been in continuous use for 900 years, beginning as the medicine garden for the monks of the abbey and now overlooked by canons\' houses and the dormitory for Westminster School.\nThe newest part of the abbey is the Weston Tower, finished in 2018 and designed by Ptolemy Dean. It sits between the chapter house and the Henry VII Chapel, and contains a lift shaft and spiral staircase to allow public access to the triforium, which contains the Queen\'s Diamond Jubilee Galleries. The tower has a star-shaped floorplan and leaded windows with an elaborate crown rooftop. The lift shaft inside is faced with 16 kinds of stone from the abbey\'s history, including Purbeck marble, Reigate stone, and Portland stone. The project took five years and cost £22.9 million.

The 13th-century interior would have been painted in bright colours and gilded, although the piers would have been left unpainted.\nAlthough the nave was built over the course of centuries from the east to the west end, generations of builders stuck to the original design and it has a unified style. Markers of the long gap in building between 1269 and 1376 are relatively minor, but can be seen at the fifth bay from the crossing.

1. **Height-to-Width Ratio**: Unlike traditional English Gothic churches, which often have a lower height-to-width ratio with large and elaborate towers, Westminster Abbey has one of the highest naves in England. This gives it a more vertical emphasis compared to other medieval English churches of similar height. The nave is also much narrower than those found in typical English Gothic structures, aligning it more closely with French Gothic styles.

2. **Positioning of the Choir**: In traditional English Gothic architecture, the choir is typically located west of the crossing. However, at Westminster Abbey, the choir is positioned to the east of the crossing. This design choice mirrors that seen in Rheims Cathedral and was made to accommodate longer transepts for hosting large numbers of guests during coronations.

Originally constructed in the 13th and 14th centuries, these cloisters were integral to the daily operations of the monastery that once occupied the site.

### Historical Significance

1. **Architectural Style**: The cloisters are a prime example of Gothic architecture, characterized by their elegant arches and detailed stonework. They date back to around 1250 for the northern entrance and the northern end of the east cloister, with the rest completed between 1352 and 1366.

2. **Monastic Functions**: During monastic times, each section of the cloisters had a specific purpose:
   - **West Cloister**: Used for teaching novice monks.
   - **North Cloister**: Designated for private study, reflecting its importance in scholarly activities within the monastery.
   - **South Cloister**: Led to the refectory where communal meals were held.
   - **East Cloister**: Connected to the chapter house and dormitory, essential areas for monastic governance and rest.

3. **Cellarium**: Located in the southwest corner of the cloisters, this storage area was used by monks to store food and wine, highlighting its role in sustaining the monastery's daily needs.

### Modern Adaptations

1. **Café Functionality**: The cellarium has been repurposed as the abbey café, blending historical architecture with modern hospitality functions. This adaptation allows visitors to experience a piece of monastic history while enjoying contemporary amenities.

2. **Little Cloister and College Garden**: The Little Cloister, dating from the late 17th century, features a small garden with a central fountain. It connects to College Garden, which has been in continuous use for over 900 years. Originally serving as a medicinal herb garden for monks, it now provides a serene space for reflection amidst the bustling city.

3. **Public Access and Education**: The cloisters serve as an educational resource, offering insights into medieval monastic life through guided tours and informational displays. They allow visitors to appreciate the architectural evolution and historical context of Westminster Abbey.

In summary, the cloisters at Westminster Abbey are a testament to their original monastic functions while seamlessly integrating modern uses that enhance visitor experience and preserve historical heritage.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4),./data/4_wiki_pages.csv

The Chancellor's Building was opened on 12 August 2002 by Prince Philip, housing the new Edinburgh Medical School alongside the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In 2007, the campus saw the addition of the Euan MacDonald Centre as a research centre for motor neuron diseases, which was part-funded by Scottish entrepreneur Euan MacDonald and his father Donald. In August 2010, author J. K. Rowling provided £10 million in funding to create the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, which was officially opened in October 2013. The Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM) is a stem cell research centre dedicated to the development of regenerative treatments, which was opened in 2012. CRM is also home to applied scientists working with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) and Roslin Cells.\n\nIn December 2002, the Edinburgh Cowgate fire destroyed a number of university buildings, including some 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) of the School of Informatics at 80 South Bridge. This was replaced with the Informatics Forum on Bristo Square, completed in July 2008. Also in 2002, the Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre (ECRC) was opened on the Western General Hospital site. In 2007, the MRC Human Genetics Unit formed a partnership with the Centre for Genomic & Experimental Medicine and the ECRC to create the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine (renamed the Institute of Genetics and Cancer in 2021) on the same site.\nIn April 2008, the Roslin Institute – an animal sciences research centre known for cloning Dolly the sheep – became part of the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies. In 2011, the school moved into a new £60 million building on the Easter Bush campus, which now houses research and teaching facilities, and a hospital for small and farm animals.\n\nEdinburgh College of Art, founded in 1760, formally merged with the university's School of Arts, Culture and Environment on 1 August 2011. In 2014, the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute (ZJE) was founded as an international joint institute offering degrees in biomedical sciences, taught in English. The campus, located in Haining, Zhejiang Province, China, was established on 15 March 2016.\nThe university began hosting a Wikimedian in Residence in 2016. The residency was made into a full-time position in 2019, with the Wikimedian involved in teaching and learning activities within the scope of the University of Edinburgh WikiProject.\nIn 2018, the University of Edinburgh was a signatory to the £1.3 billion Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal, in partnership with the UK and Scottish governments, six local authorities and all universities and colleges in the region. The university committed to delivering a range of economic benefits to the region through the Data-Driven Innovation initiative. In conjunction with Heriot-Watt University, the deal created five innovation hubs: the Bayes Centre, Edinburgh Futures Institute, Usher Institute, Easter Bush, and one further hub based at Heriot-Watt, the National Robotarium. The deal also included creation of the Edinburgh International Data Facility, which performs high-speed data processing in a secure environment.\nIn September 2020, the university completed work on the Richard Verney Health Centre at its central area campus on Bristo Square. The facility houses a health centre and pharmacy, and the university's disability and counselling services. The university's largest expansion in the 2020s was the conversion of some of the historic Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place, which had been vacated in 2003 and partially developed into the Quartermile. The £120 million project created a home for the Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI), an interdisciplinary hub linking arts, humanities, and social sciences with other disciplines in the research and teaching of complex, multi-stakeholder societal challenges. The EFI officially opened its doors to the public on 4 June 2024.""]","

136,How does the General Council ensure the continued voice of graduates?,"[""==== General Council ====\nThe General Council consists of graduates, academic staff, current and former University Court members. It was established to ensure that graduates have a continuing voice in the management of the university. The Council is required to meet twice per year to consider matters affecting the wellbeing and prosperity of the university. The Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 gave the Council the power to consider draft ordinances and resolutions, to be presented with an annual report of the work and activities of the university, and to receive an audited financial statement. The Council elects the chancellor of the university and three Assessors on the University Court.\n\n\n==== Senatus Academicus ====\nThe Senatus Academicus is the university's supreme academic body, chaired by the principal and consisting of the professors, heads of departments, and a number of readers, lecturers and other teaching and research staff. The core function of the Senatus is to regulate and supervise the teaching and discipline of the university and to promote research. The Senatus elects four Assessors on the University Court. The Senatus meets three times per year, hosting a presentation and discussion session which is open to all members of staff at each meeting.\n\n\n==== University officials ====\n\nThe university's three most significant officials are its chancellor, rector, and principal, whose rights and responsibilities are largely derived from the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.\nThe office of chancellor serves as the titular head and highest office of the university. Their duties include conferring degrees and enhancing the profile and reputation of the university on national and global levels. The chancellor is elected by the university's General Council, and a person generally remains in the office for life. Previous chancellors include former prime minister Arthur Balfour and novelist Sir J. M. Barrie. Princess Anne has held the position since March 2011 succeeding Prince Philip. She is also Patron of the university's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.\nThe principal is responsible for the overall operation of the university in a chief executive role. The principal is formally nominated by the Curators of Patronage and appointed by the University Court. They are the President of the Senatus Academicus and a member of the University Court ex officio. The principal is also automatically appointed vice-chancellor, in which role they confer degrees on behalf of the chancellor. Previous principals include physicist Sir Edward Appleton and religious philosopher Stewart Sutherland. The current principal is nephrologist Sir Peter Mathieson, who has held the position since February 2018.\nThe office of rector is elected every three years by the staff and matriculated students. The primary role of the rector is to preside at the University Court. The rector also chairs meetings of the General Council in absence of the chancellor. They work closely with students and Edinburgh University Students' Association. Previous rectors include microbiologist Sir Alexander Fleming, and former Prime Ministers Sir Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George. The current rector is activist and writer Simon Fanshawe, who has held the position since March 2024.\n\n\n=== Colleges and schools ===\nIn 2002, the university was reorganised from its nine faculties into three 'Colleges'. While technically not a collegiate university, it comprises the Colleges of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (CAHSS), Science & Engineering (CSE) and Medicine & Vet Medicine (CMVM). Within these colleges are 'Schools', which either represent one academic discipline such as Informatics or assemble adjacent academic disciplines such as the School of History, Classics and Archaeology. While bound by College-level policies, individual Schools can differ in their organisation and governance. As of 2021, the university has 21 schools in total.\n\n\n==== Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences ====\n\nThe College took on its current name of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences in 2016 after absorbing the Edinburgh College of Art in 2011. CAHSS offers more than 280 undergraduate degree programmes, 230 taught postgraduate programmes, and 200 research postgraduate programmes. Twenty subjects offered by the college were ranked within the top 10 nationally in the 2022 Complete University Guide. It includes the oldest English Literature department in Britain, which was ranked 7th globally in the 2021 QS Rankings by Subject in English Language & Literature. The college hosts Scotland's ESRC Doctoral Training Centre (DTC), the Scottish Graduate School of Social Science. The college is the largest of the three colleges by enrolment, with 26,130 students and 3,089 academic staff.""]","

The University of Edinburgh's recruitment strategy has evolved over the years, starting with an initial reliance on traditional methods like personal recommendations and local connections and gradually shifting towards a more data-driven and targeted approach.  Here's a breakdown of the key changes:

*   **Early Days (1960s-1980s):** Early recruitment relied heavily on personal recommendations, local connections, and alumni networks. These methods were often slow and inefficient, resulting in a limited pool of candidates.

*   **Mid-to-Late 1980s - 2000s:** A shift began to incorporate more systematic methods like UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service) applications. This allowed for a more standardized and scalable recruitment process, though it still relied on broad networks.

*   **2010s - Present:**  The university has significantly expanded its online recruitment efforts, utilizing modern digital platforms like Coursera, Edx, and FutureLearn, significantly reducing reliance on traditional sources.  Further, the university has focused on targeted marketing campaigns, using data analytics to identify potential applicants based on their academic profiles and interests.

681,What is Charles Robert Darwin's primary contribution to evolutionary biology?,"[""Charles Robert Darwin ( DAR-win; 12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, widely known for his contributions to evolutionary biology. His proposition that all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally accepted and considered a fundamental scientific concept. In a joint presentation with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history and was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.\nDarwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh; instead, he helped to investigate marine invertebrates. His studies at the University of Cambridge's Christ's College from 1828 to 1831 encouraged his passion for natural science. However, it was his five-year voyage on HMS Beagle from 1831 to 1836 that truly established Darwin as an eminent geologist. The observations and theories he developed during his voyage supported Charles Lyell's concept of gradual geological change. Publication of his journal of the voyage made Darwin famous as a popular author.\nPuzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and, in 1838, devised his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research, and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting the immediate joint submission of both their theories to the Linnean Society of London. Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of natural diversification. In 1871, he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). His research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.\nDarwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many initially favoured  competing explanations that gave only a minor role to natural selection, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.\n\n\n== Biography ==""]","

682,What was the primary reason for Darwin’s departure from Sedgwick's estate and the decision to pursue a self-funded expedition?,"['=== Survey voyage on HMS Beagle ===\n\nAfter leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a few days with student friends at Barmouth. He returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) naturalist for a self-funded supernumerary place on HMS Beagle with captain Robert FitzRoy, a position for a gentleman rather than ""a mere collector"". The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America. Robert Darwin objected to his son\'s planned two-year voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, Josiah Wedgwood II, to agree to (and fund) his son\'s participation. Darwin took care to remain in a private capacity to retain control over his collection, intending it for a major scientific institution.\nAfter delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations. At intervals during the voyage, his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas, was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected during a calm spell.\n\nOn their first stop ashore at St Jago in Cape Verde, Darwin found that a white band high in the volcanic rock cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of Charles Lyell\'s Principles of Geology, which set out uniformitarian concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,[II] and Darwin saw things Lyell\'s way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology.

The initial reaction of other members of the crew, particularly the Fuegians, to Darwin's arrival was mixed. While most were initially friendly and civilised, the Fuegians, who had been seized during the first Beagle voyage, were often seen as different from domesticated animals. They were viewed with suspicion and a degree of pity by the crew, who recognised their past hardships and treated them with a degree of compassion, yet the presence of these diverse native peoples presented challenges to Darwin's plans for scientific observation and integration. Their presence disrupted the established routine and forced the crew to reconsider their strategies for scientific study. It also led to a greater awareness of the complexities of colonial interactions and the need for a more nuanced understanding of indigenous populations.

He heard that slight variations in the shape of tortoise shells showed which island they came from, but failed to collect them, even after eating tortoises taken on board as food. In Australia, the marsupial rat-kangaroo and the platypus seemed so unusual that Darwin thought it was almost as though two distinct Creators had been at work. He found the Aborigines ""good-humoured & pleasant"", their numbers depleted by European settlement.\nFitzRoy investigated how the atolls of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands had formed, and the survey supported Darwin\'s theorising. FitzRoy began writing the official Narrative of the Beagle voyages, and after reading Darwin\'s diary, he proposed incorporating it into the account. Darwin\'s Journal was eventually rewritten as a separate third volume, on geology and natural history.\nIn Cape Town, South Africa, Darwin and FitzRoy met John Herschel, who had recently written to Lyell praising his uniformitarianism as opening bold speculation on ""that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others"" as ""a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process"".\nWhen organising his notes as the ship sailed home, Darwin wrote that, if his growing suspicions about the mockingbirds, the tortoises and the Falkland Islands fox were correct, ""such facts undermine the stability of Species"", then cautiously added ""would"" before ""undermine"".

686,What was Charles Lyell's primary motivation for meeting with Darwin?,"['He later wrote that such facts ""seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species"".\nWithout telling Darwin, extracts from his letters to Henslow had been read to scientific societies, printed as a pamphlet for private distribution among members of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, and reported in magazines, including The Athenaeum. Darwin first heard of this at Cape Town, and at Ascension Island read of Sedgwick\'s prediction that Darwin ""will have a great name among the Naturalists of Europe"".\n\n\n=== Inception of Darwin\'s evolutionary theory ===\n\nOn 2 October 1836, Beagle anchored at Falmouth, Cornwall. Darwin promptly made the long coach journey to Shrewsbury to visit his home and see relatives. He then hurried to Cambridge to see Henslow, who advised him on finding available naturalists to catalogue Darwin\'s animal collections and to take on the botanical specimens. Darwin\'s father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded gentleman scientist, and an excited Darwin went around the London institutions being fêted and seeking experts to describe the collections. British zoologists at the time had a huge backlog of work, due to natural history collecting being encouraged throughout the British Empire, and there was a danger of specimens just being left in storage.\nCharles Lyell eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October and soon introduced him to the up-and-coming anatomist Richard Owen, who had the facilities of the Royal College of Surgeons to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen\'s surprising results included other gigantic extinct ground sloths as well as the Megatherium Darwin had identified, a near complete skeleton of the unknown Scelidotherium and a hippopotamus-sized rodent-like skull named Toxodon resembling a giant capybara. The armour fragments were actually from Glyptodon, a huge armadillo-like creature, as Darwin had initially thought. These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.\nIn mid-December, Darwin took lodgings in Cambridge to arrange expert classification of his collections, and prepare his own research for publication. Questions of how to combine his diary into the Narrative were resolved at the end of the month when FitzRoy accepted Broderip\'s advice to make it a separate volume, and Darwin began work on his Journal and Remarks.\nDarwin\'s first paper showed that the South American landmass was slowly rising. With Lyell\'s enthusiastic backing, he read it to the Geological Society of London on 4 January 1837. On the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the Zoological Society. The ornithologist John Gould soon announced that the Galápagos birds that Darwin had thought a mixture of blackbirds, ""gros-beaks"" and finches, were, in fact, twelve separate species of finches. On 17 February, Darwin was elected to the Council of the Geological Society, and Lyell\'s presidential address presented Owen\'s findings on Darwin\'s fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his uniformitarian ideas.\n\nEarly in March, Darwin moved to London to be near this work, joining Lyell\'s social circle of scientists and experts such as Charles Babbage, who described God as a programmer of laws. Darwin stayed with his freethinking brother Erasmus, part of this Whig circle and a close friend of the writer Harriet Martineau, who promoted the Malthusianism that underpinned the controversial Whig Poor Law reforms to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a Unitarian, she welcomed the radical implications of transmutation of species, promoted by Grant and younger surgeons influenced by Geoffroy. Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order, but reputable scientists openly discussed the subject, and there was wide interest in John Herschel\'s letter praising Lyell\'s approach as a way to find a natural cause of the origin of new species.\nGould met Darwin and told him that the Galápagos mockingbirds from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a ""wren"" was in the finch group. Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the ship, including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands. The two rheas were distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.\nBy mid-March 1837, barely six months after his return to England, Darwin was speculating in his Red Notebook on the possibility that ""one species does change into another"" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange extinct mammal Macrauchenia, which resembled a giant guanaco, a llama relative. Around mid-July, he recorded in his ""B"" notebook his thoughts on lifespan and variation across generations – explaining the variations he had observed in Galápagos tortoises, mockingbirds, and rheas. He sketched branching descent, and then a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, in which ""It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another"", thereby discarding Lamarck\'s idea of independent lineages progressing to higher forms.']","

687,What is the primary motivation behind Darwin’s intense focus on transmutation research?,"['=== Overwork, illness, and marriage ===\n\nWhile developing this intensive study of transmutation, Darwin became mired in more work. Still rewriting his Journal, he took on editing and publishing the expert reports on his collections, and with Henslow\'s help obtained a Treasury grant of £1,000 to sponsor this multi-volume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, a sum equivalent to about £115,000 in 2021. He stretched the funding to include his planned books on geology, and agreed to unrealistic dates with the publisher. As the Victorian era began, Darwin pressed on with writing his Journal, and in August 1837 began correcting printer\'s proofs.\nAs Darwin worked under pressure, his health suffered. On 20 September, he had ""an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart"", so his doctors urged him to ""knock off all work"" and live in the country for a few weeks. After visiting Shrewsbury, he joined his Wedgwood relatives at Maer Hall, Staffordshire, but found them too eager for tales of his travels to give him much rest. His charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin Emma Wedgwood, nine months older than Darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt. His uncle Josiah pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under loam and suggested that this might have been the work of earthworms, inspiring ""a new & important theory"" on their role in soil formation, which Darwin presented at the Geological Society on 1 November 1837. His Journal was printed and ready for publication by the end of February 1838, as was the first volume of the Narrative, but FitzRoy was still working hard to finish his own volume.\nWilliam Whewell pushed Darwin to take on the duties of Secretary of the Geological Society. After initially declining the work, he accepted the post in March 1838. Despite the grind of writing and editing the Beagle reports, Darwin made remarkable progress on transmutation, taking every opportunity to question expert naturalists and, unconventionally, people with practical experience in selective breeding such as farmers and pigeon fanciers. Over time, his research drew on information from his relatives and children, the family butler, neighbours, colonists and former shipmates. He included mankind in his speculations from the outset, and on seeing an orangutan in the zoo on 28 March 1838 noted its childlike behaviour.\nThe strain took a toll, and by June he was being laid up for days on end with stomach problems, headaches and heart symptoms. For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe boils, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of Darwin\'s illness remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had only ephemeral success.\nOn 23 June, he took a break and went ""geologising"" in Scotland. He visited Glen Roy in glorious weather to see the parallel ""roads"" cut into the hillsides at three heights. He later published his view that these were marine-raised beaches, but then had to accept that they were shorelines of a proglacial lake.\n\nFully recuperated, he returned to Shrewsbury in July 1838. Used to jotting down daily notes on animal breeding, he scrawled rambling thoughts about marriage, career and prospects on two scraps of paper, one with columns headed ""Marry"" and ""Not Marry"". Advantages under ""Marry"" included ""constant companion and a friend in old age ... better than a dog anyhow"", against points such as ""less money for books"" and ""terrible loss of time"". Having decided in favour of marriage, he discussed it with his father, then went to visit his cousin Emma on 29 July. At this time he did not get around to proposing, but against his father\'s advice, he mentioned his ideas on transmutation.\nHe married Emma on 29 January 1839 and they were the parents of ten children, seven of whom survived to adulthood.']","
The primary motivation behind Darwin’s intense focus on transmutation research is to pursue a scientific understanding of the fundamental laws of nature. His goal was to study the 'transmutation' of matter and the evolution of species, driven by a desire to develop a more comprehensive theory of the natural world.

688,"What is the central argument of Malthus's essay on Population, according to Darwin?","['=== Malthus and natural selection ===\nContinuing his research in London, Darwin\'s wide reading now included the sixth edition of Malthus\'s An Essay on the Principle of Population. On 28 September 1838, he noted its assertion that human ""population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty-five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio"", a geometric progression so that population soon exceeds food supply in what is known as a Malthusian catastrophe. Darwin was well-prepared to compare this to Augustin de Candolle\'s ""warring of the species"" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the ""final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, & adapt it to changes"", so that ""One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying [to] force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones."" This would result in the formation of new species. As he later wrote in his Autobiography:\n\nIn October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work...\nBy mid-December, Darwin saw a similarity between farmers picking the best stock in selective breeding, and a Malthusian Nature selecting from chance variants so that ""every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected"", thinking this comparison ""a beautiful part of my theory"". He later called his theory natural selection, an analogy with what he termed the ""artificial selection"" of selective breeding.\nOn 11 November, he returned to Maer and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas. She accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, while expressing her strong Unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife. While he was house-hunting in London, bouts of illness continued and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking ""So don\'t be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you."" He found what they called ""Macaw Cottage"" (because of its gaudy interiors) in Gower Street, then moved his ""museum"" in over Christmas. On 24 January 1839, Darwin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).\nOn 29 January, Darwin and Emma Wedgwood were married at Maer in an Anglican ceremony arranged to suit the Unitarians, then immediately caught the train to London and their new home.']","
According to Darwin, Malthus's essay on Population argues that human ""population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty-five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio"", suggesting that population exceeds food supply in what is known as a Malthusian catastrophe.

689,"How did Darwin's initial research into barnacles influence his overall approach to studying other species, as evidenced by his extensive experimental selective breeding?***","['=== Geology books, barnacles, evolutionary research ===\n\nDarwin now had the framework of his theory of natural selection ""by which to work"", as his ""prime hobby"". His research included extensive experimental selective breeding of plants and animals, finding evidence that species were not fixed and investigating many detailed ideas to refine and substantiate his theory. For fifteen years this work was in the background to his main occupation of writing on geology and publishing expert reports on the Beagle collections, in particular, the barnacles. \nThe impetus of Darwin\'s barnacle research came from a collection of a barnacle colony from Chile in 1835, which he dubbed Mr. Arthrobalanus. His confusion over the relationship of this species (Cryptophialus minutus) to other barnacles caused him to fixate on the systematics of the taxa. He wrote his first examination of the species in 1846 but did not formally describe it until 1854.\nFitzRoy\'s long-delayed Narrative was published in May 1839. Darwin\'s Journal and Remarks got good reviews as the third volume, and on 15 August it was published on its own. Early in 1842, Darwin wrote about his ideas to Charles Lyell, who noted that his ally ""denies seeing a beginning to each crop of species"".\nDarwin\'s book The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs on his theory of atoll formation was published in May 1842 after more than three years of work, and he then wrote his first ""pencil sketch"" of his theory of natural selection. To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural Down House in Kent in September. On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing with melodramatic humour ""it is like confessing a murder"". Hooker replied, ""There may, in my opinion, have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species. I shall be delighted to hear how you think that this change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject.""\n\nBy July, Darwin had expanded his ""sketch"" into a 230-page ""Essay"", to be expanded with his research results if he died prematurely. In November, the anonymously published sensational best-seller Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation brought wide interest in transmutation. Darwin scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but carefully reviewed his own arguments. Controversy erupted, and it continued to sell well despite contemptuous dismissal by scientists.\nDarwin completed his third geological book in 1846. He now renewed a fascination and expertise in marine invertebrates, dating back to his student days with Grant, by dissecting and classifying the barnacles he had collected on the voyage, enjoying observing beautiful structures and thinking about comparisons with allied structures. In 1847, Hooker read the ""Essay"" and sent notes that provided Darwin with the calm critical feedback that he needed, but would not commit himself and questioned Darwin\'s opposition to continuing acts of creation.\nIn an attempt to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went in 1849 to Dr. James Gully\'s Malvern spa and was surprised to find some benefit from hydrotherapy. Then, in 1851, his treasured daughter Annie fell ill, reawakening his fears that his illness might be hereditary. She died the same year after a long series of crises.\nIn eight years of work on barnacles, Darwin\'s theory helped him to find ""homologies"" showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and in some genera he found minute males parasitic on hermaphrodites, showing an intermediate stage in evolution of distinct sexes. In 1853, it earned him the Royal Society\'s Royal Medal, and it made his reputation as a biologist. Upon the conclusion of his research, Darwin declared ""I hate a barnacle as no man ever did before."" In 1854, he became a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, gaining postal access to its library. He began a major reassessment of his theory of species, and in November realised that divergence in the character of descendants could be explained by them becoming adapted to ""diversified places in the economy of nature"".\n\n\n=== Publication of the theory of natural selection ===\n\nBy the start of 1856, Darwin was investigating whether eggs and seeds could survive travel across seawater to spread species across oceans. Hooker increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend Thomas Henry Huxley was still firmly against the transmutation of species. Lyell was intrigued by Darwin\'s speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by Alfred Russel Wallace, ""On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species"", he saw similarities with Darwin\'s thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence.']","

Darwin’s initial research into barnacles profoundly influenced his approach to studying other species. His extensive experimental selective breeding of plants and animals, particularly focusing on the systematic study of the taxa, gave him a deep understanding of how species are related. This fostered an appreciation for the importance of studying variations within groups. He used this systematic approach in his later work, particularly in his exploration of marine invertebrates. His research on barnacles provided him with a framework for understanding how species change and adapt, laying the groundwork for his theory of natural selection. The detailed observations and comparisons of barnacle structures revealed patterns of variation and adaptation that underpinned his theoretical understanding of evolution.

It wasn't simply about 'working on barnacles', but a holistic system of observation. His interest in the barnacles led to an expansive framework for studying different animal groupings. He had a methodical approach to observing differences and a keen sense of understanding the relationships between different groups. The work with the barnacles allowed him to see the value of variation and adaptation.

Charles Kingsley attempted to influence the religious community regarding Darwin’s views by attempting to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. The Bishop of Oxford’s response was pivotal. While not directly challenging Darwin’s ideas, his intervention – condemning the clergy’s dismissal of natural selection and praising Darwin – effectively diverted attention from Darwin and reaffirmed the dominance of science over religion. It symbolized a triumph of science over faith.

In 1863, Lyell\'s Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley\'s Evidence as to Man\'s Place in Nature showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then The Naturalist on the River Amazons by Henry Walter Bates provided empirical evidence of natural selection. Lobbying brought Darwin Britain\'s highest scientific honour, the Royal Society\'s Copley Medal, awarded on 3 November 1864. That day, Huxley held the first meeting of what became the influential ""X Club"" devoted to ""science, pure and free, untrammelled by religious dogmas"". By the end of the decade, most scientists agreed that evolution occurred, but only a minority supported Darwin\'s view that the chief mechanism was natural selection.\nThe Origin of Species was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the ""working men"" who flocked to Huxley\'s lectures. Darwin\'s theory resonated with various movements at the time[V] and became a key fixture of popular culture.[VI] Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain, these droll images served to popularise Darwin\'s theory in an unthreatening way. While ill in 1862, Darwin began growing a beard, and when he reappeared in public in 1866, caricatures of him as an ape helped to identify all forms of evolutionism with Darwinism.\nOthniel C. Marsh, America\'s first palaeontologist, was the first to provide solid fossil evidence to support Darwin\'s theory of evolution by unearthing the ancestors of the modern horse.  In 1877, Marsh delivered a very influential speech before the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, providing a demonstrative argument for evolution.  For the first time, Marsh traced the evolution of vertebrates from fish all the way through humans.  Sparing no detail, he listed a wealth of fossil examples of past life forms.

697,What is the primary reason Darwin's theory of evolution was initially met with criticism?,"['In response to objections that the origin of life was unexplained, Darwin pointed to acceptance of Newton\'s law even though the cause of gravity was unknown. Despite criticisms and reservations related to this topic, he nevertheless proposed a prescient idea in an 1871 letter to Hooker in which he suggested the origin of life may have occurred in a ""warm little pond"".\nDarwinism became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863, Lyell\'s Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley\'s Evidence as to Man\'s Place in Nature showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then The Naturalist on the River Amazons by Henry Walter Bates provided empirical evidence of natural selection. Lobbying brought Darwin Britain\'s highest scientific honour, the Royal Society\'s Copley Medal, awarded on 3 November 1864. That day, Huxley held the first meeting of what became the influential ""X Club"" devoted to ""science, pure and free, untrammelled by religious dogmas"". By the end of the decade, most scientists agreed that evolution occurred, but only a minority supported Darwin\'s view that the chief mechanism was natural selection.\nThe Origin of Species was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the ""working men"" who flocked to Huxley\'s lectures. Darwin\'s theory resonated with various movements at the time[V] and became a key fixture of popular culture.[VI] Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain, these droll images served to popularise Darwin\'s theory in an unthreatening way. While ill in 1862, Darwin began growing a beard, and when he reappeared in public in 1866, caricatures of him as an ape helped to identify all forms of evolutionism with Darwinism.\nOthniel C. Marsh, America\'s first palaeontologist, was the first to provide solid fossil evidence to support Darwin\'s theory of evolution by unearthing the ancestors of the modern horse.  In 1877, Marsh delivered a very influential speech before the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, providing a demonstrative argument for evolution.  For the first time, Marsh traced the evolution of vertebrates from fish all the way through humans.  Sparing no detail, he listed a wealth of fossil examples of past life forms.  The significance of this speech was immediately recognized by the scientific community, and it was printed in its entirety in several scientific journals.']","

Darwin's 1861 book on insect pollination demonstrated that wild orchids, whose flowers were specifically adapted to attract specific moths, showed adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths. This key significance was that it provided testable predictions about the relationship between flowers and moths, showing that natural selection could explain complex ecological relationships.

At the time of his death, the physicians diagnosed ""anginal attacks"", and ""heart-failure""; there has since been scholarly speculation about his life-long health issues.\nHe died at Down House on 19 April 1882. His last words were to his family, telling Emma, ""I am not the least afraid of death—Remember what a good wife you have been to me—Tell all my children to remember how good they have been to me"". While she rested, he repeatedly told Henrietta and Francis, ""It\'s almost worthwhile to be sick to be nursed by you"".\nHe had expected to be buried in St Mary\'s churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwin\'s colleagues, after public and parliamentary petitioning, William Spottiswoode (President of the Royal Society) arranged for Darwin to be honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel and Isaac Newton. The funeral, held on Wednesday 26 April, was attended by thousands of people, including family, friends, scientists, philosophers and dignitaries.\n\n\n== Children ==\n\nThe Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and Annie\'s death at the age of ten had a devastating effect on her parents. Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly attentive to his children. Whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might have inherited weaknesses from inbreeding due to the close family ties he shared with his wife and cousin, Emma Wedgwood. He examined inbreeding in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of outcrossing in many species.\n\nCharles Waring Darwin, born in December 1856, was the tenth and last of the children. Emma Darwin was aged 48 at the time of the birth, and the child was mentally subnormal and never learnt to walk or talk. He probably had Down syndrome, which had not then been medically described. The evidence is a photograph by William Erasmus Darwin of the infant and his mother, showing a characteristic head shape, and the family\'s observations of the child. Charles Waring died of scarlet fever on 28 June 1858, when Darwin wrote in his journal: ""Poor dear Baby died."" \nOf his surviving children, George, Francis and Horace became Fellows of the Royal Society, distinguished as an astronomer, botanist and civil engineer, respectively. All three were knighted. Another son, Leonard, went on to be a soldier, politician, economist, eugenicist, and mentor of the statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher.\n\n\n== Views and opinions ==']","
The text reveals that the father, Charles Darwin, possessed a certain outlook on life. He had a health issue that caused him to be involved in various speculations about his life, particularly concerning his long-term health issues and perhaps some form of unexplained ailments. He expressed concern for his family, especially his daughters, and displayed a paternal love towards them. He was a man of deep reflection and thoughtful observations, with a curious mind that constantly sought to understand the world through natural selection. He had a strong connection to his family, with an emphasis on the importance of his children's well-being and a sense of duty.

=== Conclusion ===
---------------------
The text presents an insightful portrait of Charles Darwin as a complex individual, demonstrating his health issues, his reflections on life, his family devotion, and his intellectual curiosity. He was a man with a unique perspective on the natural world, shaped by his experiences and a desire to understand the interconnectedness of life.

To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs. Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver.

702,"How did Darwin's upbringing and family influence his views on social and political issues, specifically regarding slavery, and his interactions with indigenous populations?","['=== Human society ===\nDarwin\'s views on social and political issues reflected his time and social position. He grew up in a family of Whig reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported electoral reform and the emancipation of slaves. Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants.\nTaking taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave John Edmonstone, whom Darwin long recalled as ""a very pleasant and intelligent man"", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the Beagle voyage. Though commonplace in Britain at the time, Silliman and Bachman noticed the contrast with slave-owning America. Around twenty years later, racism became a feature of British society, but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against ""ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species"", and against ill-treatment of native people.[VII]\nDarwin\'s interaction with Yaghans (Fuegians) such as Jemmy Button during the second voyage of HMS Beagle had a profound impact on his view of indigenous peoples. At his arrival in Tierra del Fuego he made a colourful description of ""Fuegian savages"". This view changed as he came to know Yaghan people more in detail. By studying the Yaghans, Darwin concluded that a number of basic emotions by different human groups were the same and that mental capabilities were roughly the same as for Europeans. While interested in Yaghan culture, Darwin failed to appreciate their deep ecological knowledge and elaborate cosmology until the 1850s when he inspected a dictionary of Yaghan detailing 32,000 words. He saw that European colonisation would often lead to the extinction of native civilisations, and ""tr[ied] to integrate colonialism into an evolutionary history of civilization analogous to natural history"".\nDarwin\'s view of women was that men\'s eminence over them was the outcome of sexual selection, a view disputed by Antoinette Brown Blackwell in her 1875 book The Sexes Throughout Nature.\nDarwin was intrigued by his half-cousin Francis Galton\'s argument, introduced in 1865, that statistical analysis of heredity showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. In The Descent of Man, Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, ""the noblest part of our nature"", and factors such as education could be more important. When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a ""caste"" of ""those who are naturally gifted"", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties and thought it ""the sole feasible, yet I fear utopian, plan of procedure in improving the human race"", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals. Francis Galton named this field of study ""eugenics"" in 1883,[VIII] after Darwin\'s death, and his theories were cited to promote eugenic policies.']","
Darwin's upbringing and family significantly influenced his views on social and political issues. His family's Whig reformist background, combined with his uncle Josiah Wedgwood's support for electoral reform and emancipation, instilled in him a deep opposition to slavery and a belief in the inherent equality of all people. His experience with the freed slave John Edmonstone solidified this opposition, and his encounters with native people on the Beagle voyage shaped his view of indigenous peoples. The contrast between his views on slavery and his interaction with Yaghans in Tierra del Fuego heightened his awareness of the complexities of race and the potential dangers of colonial domination.  His views on women, influenced by the disputed concept of sexual selection, and his engagement with Galton's theories of heredity, ultimately led to his concerns about the dangers of genetic manipulation and the need for carefully considered social policies.

Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and Herbert Spencer\'s 1851 book Social Statics based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.\nSoon after the Origin was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a Malthusian justification for the English industrial capitalism of the time. The term Darwinism was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer\'s ""survival of the fittest"" as free-market progress, and Ernst Haeckel\'s polygenistic ideas of human development. Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat-dog capitalism, colonialism and imperialism. However, Darwin\'s holistic view of nature included ""dependence of one being on another""; thus pacifists, socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin stressed the value of cooperation over struggle within a species. Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.\nAfter the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin\'s cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in ""positive eugenics"". During the ""Eclipse of Darwinism"", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by Mendelian genetics. Negative eugenics to remove the ""feebleminded"" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and eugenics in the United States introduced compulsory sterilisation laws, followed by several other countries. Subsequently, Nazi eugenics brought the field into disrepute.[VIII]\nThe term ""Social Darwinism"" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by Richard Hofstadter to attack the laissez-faire conservatism of those like William Graham Sumner who opposed reform and socialism. Since then, it has been used as a term of abuse by those opposed to what they think are the moral consequences of evolution.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nDarwin was a prolific writer. Even without the publication of his works on evolution, he would have had a considerable reputation as the author of The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.']","

704,What was the primary influence of Darwin’s work on the evolution of scientific thought?,"['== Legacy and commemoration ==\n\nAs Alfred Russel Wallace put it, Darwin had ""wrought a greater revolution in human thought within a quarter of a century than any man of our time – or perhaps any time"", having ""given us a new conception of the world of life, and a theory which is itself a powerful instrument of research; has shown us how to combine into one consistent whole the facts accumulated by all the separate classes of workers, and has thereby revolutionised the whole study of nature"". The paleoanthropologist Trenton Holliday states that ""Darwin is rightly considered to be the preeminent evolutionary scientist of all time"".\nBy around 1880, most scientists were convinced of evolution as descent with modification, though few agreed with Darwin that natural selection ""has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification"". During ""the eclipse of Darwinism"" scientists explored alternative mechanisms. Then Ronald Fisher incorporated Mendelian genetics in The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, leading to population genetics and the modern evolutionary synthesis, which continues to develop. Scientific discoveries have confirmed and validated Darwin\'s key insights.\nGeographical features given his name include Darwin Sound and Mount Darwin, both named while he was on the Beagle voyage, and Darwin Harbour, named by his former shipmates on its next voyage, which eventually became the location of Darwin, the capital city of Australia\'s Northern Territory. Darwin\'s name was given, formally or informally, to numerous plants and animals, including many he had collected on the voyage. The Linnean Society of London began awards of the Darwin–Wallace Medal in 1908, to mark fifty years from the joint reading on 1 July 1858 of papers by Darwin and Wallace publishing their theory. Further awards were made in 1958 and 2008; since 2010, the awards have been annual. Darwin College, a postgraduate college at Cambridge University founded in 1964, is named after the Darwin family. From 2000 to 2017, UK £10 banknotes issued by the Bank of England featured Darwin\'s portrait printed on the reverse, along with a hummingbird and HMS Beagle.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==']","
Darwin’s work had a profound influence on the evolution of scientific thought by demonstrating the power of integrating multiple observations and theories into a unified framework. By showcasing the principle of natural selection as a key mechanism of evolutionary change, he spurred a shift from alternative explanations for evolutionary processes to a robust and widely accepted theory. The influence of Darwin's work went far beyond simply proposing evolution; it revolutionized the entire study of nature and inspired countless scientists to build upon his foundational insights.

Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\nWestminster Abbey, formally titled the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter at Westminster, is an Anglican church in the City of Westminster, London, England. Since 1066, it has been the location of the coronations of 40 English and British monarchs and a burial site for 18 English, Scottish, and British monarchs. At least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey since 1100.\nAlthough the origins of the church are obscure, an abbey housing Benedictine monks was on the site by the mid-10th century. The church got its first large building from the 1040s, commissioned by King Edward the Confessor, who is buried inside. Construction of the present church began in 1245 on the orders of Henry III. The monastery was dissolved in 1559, and the church was made a royal peculiar – a Church of England church, accountable directly to the sovereign – by Elizabeth I. The abbey, the Palace of Westminster and St Margaret\'s Church became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 because of their historic and symbolic significance.\nThe church\'s Gothic architecture is chiefly inspired by 13th-century French and English styles, although some sections of the church have earlier Romanesque styles or later Baroque and modern styles. The Henry VII Chapel, at the east end of the church, is a typical example of Perpendicular Gothic architecture; antiquarian John Leland called it orbis miraculum (""the wonder of the world"").\nThe abbey is the burial site of more than 3,300 people, many prominent in British history: monarchs, prime ministers, poets laureate, actors, musicians, scientists, military leaders, and the Unknown Warrior. Due to the fame of the figures buried there, artist William Morris described the abbey as a ""National Valhalla"".\n\n\n== History ==\nHistorians agree that there was a monastery dedicated to Saint Peter on the site prior to the 11th century, though its exact origin is somewhat obscure. One legend claims that it was founded by the Saxon king Sæberht of Essex, and another claims that its founder was the fictional 2nd-century British king Lucius. One tradition claims that a young fisherman on the River Thames had a vision of Saint Peter near the site.

The information regarding the history of the abbey is quite complex and multifaceted. It’s built upon a foundation of legends and tradition. The origin of the abbey dates back to the 9th century, with a small monastic community established by the Saxon King Sæberht of Essex and a purported fisherman’s vision. The island on the Thames, Thorney Island, which is now an archaeological site, was the original location. Early monastic life was centered on the island, and later the abbey itself was built on the site.  The abbey is known for its burial grounds, housing the remains of numerous prominent figures in British history, including monarchs, prime ministers, poets, and actors. The location of the abbey has been significantly altered over time, through a series of rulers and constructions, including the construction of the present church by Henry III and a 1559 dissolution.  The abbey has undergone significant restoration and preservation efforts, and its unique architectural style is a testament to its historical significance.

Answer: The abbey was a significant religious and political center in medieval England, evolving from a royal burial church to a major landowner and a vital part of the economy. It played a pivotal role in the transition from Anglo-Saxon to Norman England and contributed to the centralization of power under the Norman kings.

The abbey is built in the Romanesque style, characterized by thick walls, rounded arches, and small windows. Unlike the more elaborate Gothic structures of the time, this design is distinctive and emphasizes a sense of mass and stability. The use of cruciform floorplan and a central tower gives it a unique form.

How does the design compare to other structures of the period?
Compared to other medieval structures, the abbey’s design differs from the traditional Gothic style, which was characterized by soaring arches, pointed roofs, and intricate ornamentation. Its Romanesque style, with its emphasis on solid walls and small windows, set it apart. It also contrasts with the more decorative and expansive layouts found in many other monastic buildings.

The portrait of Richard II, the earliest of an English king, placed near the west door of the abbey, is a pivotal and significant piece of evidence in understanding the king's character and his vision for the church. Its presence highlights the ambition and power of the crown during a period of significant political upheaval, showcasing the king's desire for a large, visible presence within the religious institution, and the royal ownership of church lands. The portrait offers a direct connection to a time of challenging political stability and a clear desire for the king to be remembered as a benevolent leader within the abbey.

713,What was the primary reason for the dissolution of Westminster Abbey in 1550?,"['=== Dissolution and Reformation ===\nIn the 1530s, Henry VIII broke away from the authority of the Catholic Church in Rome and seized control of England\'s monasteries, including Westminster Abbey, beginning the English Reformation. In 1535, when the king\'s officers assessed the abbey\'s funds, their annual income was £3,000. Henry\'s agents removed many relics, saints\' images, and treasures from the abbey. The golden feretory that housed the coffin of Edward the Confessor was melted down, and monks hid his bones to save them from destruction. The monastery was dissolved and the building became the cathedral for the newly created Diocese of Westminster. The abbot, William Benson, became dean of the cathedral, while the prior and five of the monks were among the twelve newly created canons.\nThe Westminster diocese was dissolved in 1550, but the abbey was recognised (in 1552, retroactively to 1550) as a second cathedral of the Diocese of London until 1556. Money meant for the abbey, which is dedicated to St Peter, was diverted to the treasury of St Paul\'s Cathedral; this led to an association with the already-old saying ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"".\nThe abbey saw the return of Benedictine monks under the Catholic Mary I, but they were again ejected under Elizabeth I in 1559. In 1560, Elizabeth re-established Westminster as a ""royal peculiar"" – a church of the Church of England responsible directly to the sovereign, rather than to a diocesan bishop – and made it the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter, a non-cathedral church with an attached chapter of canons, headed by a dean. From that date onwards, the building was simply a church, though it was still called an abbey. Elizabeth also re-founded Westminster School, providing for 40 students (the King\'s (or Queen\'s) Scholars) and their schoolmasters. The King\'s Scholars have the duty of shouting Vivat Rex or Vivat Regina (""Long live the King/Queen"") during the coronation of a new monarch. In the modern day, the dean of Westminster Abbey remains the chair of the school governors.\nIn the early 17th century, the abbey hosted two of the six companies of churchmen who produced the King James Version of the Bible. They used the Jerusalem Chamber in the abbey for their meetings. The First Company was headed by the dean of the abbey, Lancelot Andrewes.\nIn 1642, the English Civil War broke out between Charles I and his own parliament. The Dean and Chapter fled the abbey at the outbreak of war, and were replaced by priests loyal to Parliament. The abbey itself suffered damage during the war; altars, stained glass, the organ, and the Crown Jewels were damaged or destroyed. Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell was given an elaborate funeral there in 1658, only for a body thought to be Cromwell\'s to be disinterred in January 1661 and posthumously hanged from a gibbet at Tyburn. In 1669, the abbey was visited by the diarist Samuel Pepys, who saw the body of the 15th-century queen Catherine de Valois. She had been buried in the 13th-century Lady chapel in 1437, but was exhumed during building work for the Henry VII Chapel and not reburied in the intervening 150 years. Pepys leaned into the coffin and kissed her on the mouth, writing ""This was my birthday, thirty-six years old and I did first kiss a queen."" She has since been re-interred close to her husband, Henry V. In 1685, during preparations for the coronation of James II, a workman accidentally put a scaffolding pole through the coffin of Edward the Confessor. A chorister, Charles Taylour, pulled a cross on a chain out of the coffin and gave it to the king, who then gave it to the Pope. Its whereabouts are unknown.']","

The abbot, William Benson, became dean of the cathedral, while the prior and five of the monks were among the twelve newly created canons.\nThe Westminster diocese was dissolved in 1550, but the abbey was recognised (in 1552, retroactively to 1550) as a second cathedral of the Diocese of London until 1556. Money meant for the abbey, which is dedicated to St Peter, was diverted to the treasury of St Paul\'s Cathedral; this led to an association with the already-old saying ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"".\nThe abbey saw the return of Benedictine monks under the Catholic Mary I, but they were again ejected under Elizabeth I in 1559. In 1560, Elizabeth re-established Westminster as a ""royal peculiar"" – a church of the Church of England responsible directly to the sovereign, rather than to a diocesan bishop – and made it the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter, a non-cathedral church with an attached chapter of canons, headed by a dean. From that date onwards, the building was simply a church, though it was still called an abbey. Elizabeth also re-founded Westminster School, providing for 40 students (the King\'s (or Queen\'s) Scholars) and their schoolmasters. The King\'s Scholars have the duty of shouting Vivat Rex or Vivat Regina (""Long live the King/Queen"") during the coronation of a new monarch. In the modern day, the dean of Westminster Abbey remains the chair of the school governors.\nIn the early 17th century, the abbey hosted two of the six companies of churchmen who produced the King James Version of the Bible. They used the Jerusalem Chamber in the abbey for their meetings. The First Company was headed by the dean of the abbey, Lancelot Andrewes.\nIn 1642, the English Civil War broke out between Charles I and his own parliament. The Dean and Chapter fled the abbey at the outbreak of war, and were replaced by priests loyal to Parliament. The abbey itself suffered damage during the war; altars, stained glass, the organ, and the Crown Jewels were damaged or destroyed. Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell was given an elaborate funeral there in 1658, only for a body thought to be Cromwell\'s to be disinterred in January 1661 and posthumously hanged from a gibbet at Tyburn. In 1669, the abbey was visited by the diarist Samuel Pepys, who saw the body of the 15th-century queen Catherine de Valois. She had been buried in the 13th-century Lady chapel in 1437, but was exhumed during building work for the Henry VII Chapel and not reburied in the intervening 150 years. Pepys leaned into the coffin and kissed her on the mouth, writing ""This was my birthday, thirty-six years old and I did first kiss a queen."" She has since been re-interred close to her husband, Henry V. In 1685, during preparations for the coronation of James II, a workman accidentally put a scaffolding pole through the coffin of Edward the Confessor. A chorister, Charles Taylour, pulled a cross on a chain out of the coffin and gave it to the king, who then gave it to the Pope. Its whereabouts are unknown.']","

718,What was the primary purpose of the proposed corona architectural feature around the lantern?,"['=== 21st century ===\n\nIn June 2009, the first major building work in 250 years was proposed. A corona – a crown-like architectural feature – was suggested to be built around the lantern over the central crossing, replacing an existing pyramidal structure dating from the 1950s. This was part of a wider £23-million development of the abbey completed in 2013. On 4 August 2010, the Dean and Chapter announced that, ""after a considerable amount of preliminary and exploratory work"", efforts toward the construction of a corona would not be continued.\nThe Cosmati pavement underwent a major cleaning and restoration programme for two years, beginning in 2008. On 17 September 2010, Pope Benedict XVI became the first pope to set foot in the abbey when he participated in a service of evening prayer with archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. On 29 April 2011, the abbey hosted the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.\nIn 2018, the Queen\'s Diamond Jubilee Galleries were opened. Located in the medieval triforium, high up around the sanctuary, they are areas for displaying the abbey\'s treasures. A new Gothic access tower with a lift was designed by the abbey architect and Surveyor of the Fabric, Ptolemy Dean.\nIn 2020, a 13th-century sacristy was uncovered in the grounds of the abbey as part of an archaeological excavation. The sacristy was used by the monks of the abbey to store objects used in Mass, such as vestments and chalices. Also on the site were hundreds of buried bodies, mostly of abbey monks.

719,What was the function of the south transept?,"[""To make the transepts match, the south transept overhangs the western cloister; this permitted a room above the cloisters which was used to store the abbey muniments. In the south transept is the chapel of St Faith, built c.\u20091250 as the vestry for the abbey's monks. On the east wall is a c.\u20091290 – c.\u20091310 painting of St Faith holding the grid-iron on which she was roasted to death.\n\n\n=== Chapter house and Pyx Chamber ===\nThe octagonal chapter house was used by the abbey monks for daily meetings, where they would hear a chapter of the Rule of St Benedict and receive their instructions for the day from the abbot. The chapter house was built between 1250 and 1259 and is one of the largest in Britain, measuring nearly 60 feet (18 m) across. For 300 years after the English Reformation, it was used to store state records until they were moved to the Public Record Office in 1863. It was restored by George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century.\nThe entrance is approached from the east cloister via outer and inner vestibules, and the ceiling becomes higher as a visitor approaches the chapter house. It is an octagonal room with a central pillar, built with a small crypt below. Around the sides are benches for 80 monks, above which are large stained-glass windows depicting the coats of arms of several monarchs and the abbey's patrons and abbots. The exterior includes flying buttresses (added in the 14th century) and a leaded roof designed by Scott. The interior walls of the chapter house are decorated with 14th- and 15th-century paintings of the Apocalypse, the Last Judgement, and birds and animals. The chapter house also has an original, mid-13th-century tiled floor. A wooden door in the vestibule, made with a tree felled between 1032 and 1064, is one of Britain's oldest. It may have been the door to the 11th-century chapter house in Edward the Confessor's abbey, and was re-used as the door to the Pyx Chamber in the 13th century. It now leads to an office.\nThe adjoining Pyx Chamber was the undercroft of the monks' dormitory. Dating to the late 11th century, it was used as a monastic and royal treasury. The outer walls and circular piers also date to the 11th century; several capitals were enriched in the 12th century, and the stone altar was added in the 13th century. The term pyx refers to the boxwood chest in which coins were held and presented to a jury during the Trial of the Pyx, when newly minted coins were presented to ensure they conformed to the required standards. The chapter house and Pyx Chamber are in the guardianship of English Heritage, but under the care and management of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster.""]","

722,What is the primary role of the abbey as depicted in the text?,"['== Royal occasions ==\nThe abbey has strong connections with the royal family. It has been patronised by monarchs, been the location for coronations, royal weddings and funerals, and several monarchs have attended services there. One monarch was born and one died at Westminster Abbey. In 1413, Henry IV collapsed while praying at the shrine of Edward the Confessor. He was moved into the Jerusalem Chamber, and died shortly afterwards. Edward V was born in the abbot\'s house in 1470.\n\nThe first jubilee celebration held at the abbey was for Queen Victoria\'s Golden Jubilee in 1887. Rather than wearing the full regalia that she had worn at her coronation, she wore her black mourning clothes topped with the insignia of the Order of the Garter and a miniature crown. She sat in the Coronation Chair—which received a coat of dark varnish for the occasion, which was painstakingly removed afterwards—making her the only monarch to sit in the chair twice.

A coronation for Jane Seymour, Henry VIII\'s third wife, was planned but she died before it took place; no coronations were planned for Henry\'s subsequent wives.

725,"Okay, here are three questions for your quiz/examination, designed to test understanding of the provided text:","[""=== Weddings ===\nAt least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey. Royal weddings at the abbey were relatively rare before the 20th century, with royals often married in a Chapel Royal or at Windsor Castle; this changed with the 1922 wedding of Princess Mary at the abbey. In 1923, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon became the first royal bride to leave her bouquet on the grave of the Unknown Warrior, a practice continued by many royal brides since.\n\nRoyal weddings have included:\n\n\n=== Funerals ===\nMany royal funerals took place at the abbey between that of Edward the Confessor in 1066 and that of Prince Henry, the last royal buried in the church, in 1790. There were no royal funerals at the abbey from then until that of Queen Alexandra in 1925; the queen was buried in Windsor Castle. Other queen consorts, such as Mary of Teck in 1953 and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002, have also had funerals at the abbey before being buried elsewhere.\nOn 6 September 1997, the ceremonial funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales was held at the abbey. Before the funeral, the railings of the abbey were swamped with flowers and tributes. The event was more widely seen than any previous occasion in the abbey's history, with 2 billion television viewers worldwide. Diana was buried privately on a private island at Althorp, her family estate.\nOn 19 September 2022, the state funeral of Elizabeth II took place at the abbey before her burial at St George's Chapel, Windsor. It was the first funeral of a monarch at Westminster Abbey for more than 260 years.\n\n\n== People ==\n\n\n=== Dean and Chapter ===\n\nWestminster Abbey is a collegiate church governed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster as established by a royal charter from Elizabeth I dated 21 May 1560, which created it as the Collegiate Church of St Peter Westminster (a royal peculiar). In 2019, David Hoyle was appointed Dean of Westminster. The chapter consists of four canons and a senior administrative officer, known as the Receiver General. One of the canons is also rector of the adjoining St Margaret's Church, Westminster, and is often the chaplain of the Speaker of the House of Commons. In addition to the dean and canons, there are minor canons.\n\n\n=== King's almsmen ===\nSix King's (or Queen's) almsmen and women are supported by the abbey. They are appointed by royal warrant on the recommendation of the dean and the Home Secretary, attend Matins and Evensong on Sundays, and perform requested duties for a small stipend. On duty, they wear a distinctive red gown with a crowned rose badge on the left shoulder.\nThe almshouse was founded near the abbey by Henry VII in 1502, and the twelve almsmen and three almswomen were originally minor court officials who were retired due to age or disability. They were required to be over the age of 50, single, with a good reputation, literate, able to look after themselves, and with an income of under £4 per year. The building survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but was demolished for road-widening in 1779. From the late 18th to the late 20th century, almsmen were usually old soldiers and sailors; today, they are primarily retired abbey employees.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\n\nWestminster School is in the abbey. Instruction has taken place since the 14th century with the monks of the abbey; the school regards its founder as Elizabeth I, who dissolved the monastery for the last time and provided for the establishment of the school, the dean, canons, assistant clergy, and lay officers. The schoolboys were rambunctious; Westminster boys have defaced the Coronation Chair, disrupted services, and once interrupted the consecration of four bishops with a bare-knuckle fight in the cloisters. One schoolboy carved on the Coronation Chair that he had slept in it overnight, making him probably its longest inhabitant. Westminster School became independent of the abbey Dean and Chapter in 1868, although the institutions remain closely connected.

The primary purpose of the abbey's original purpose was to serve as a place for royal weddings and funerals. 

Over time, it transitioned from a primarily religious venue for these events to a significant seat of power for monarchs and the aristocracy, with its role evolving to include coronations, celebrations of royal births and deaths, and official burials.

In 2022, it was announced that the abbey had given rare permission to film inside the church for Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nArchdeacon of Westminster\nList of churches in London\nAbbot of Westminster\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nThe University of Edinburgh (Scots: University o Edinburgh, Scottish Gaelic: Oilthigh Dhùn Èideann; abbreviated as Edin. in post-nominals) is a public research university based in Edinburgh, Scotland. Founded by the town council under the authority of a royal charter from King James VI in 1582 and officially opened in 1583,  it is one of Scotland\'s four ancient universities and the sixth-oldest university in continuous operation in the English-speaking world. The university played a crucial role in Edinburgh becoming a leading intellectual centre during the Scottish Enlightenment and contributed to the city being nicknamed the ""Athens of the North"".\nThe three main global university rankings (ARWU, THE, and QS) place the University of Edinburgh within their respective top 40. It is a member of several associations of research-intensive universities, including the Coimbra Group, League of European Research Universities, Russell Group, Una Europa, and Universitas 21. In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2024, the university had a total income of £1.386 billion, with £365.2 million from research grants and contracts. It has the third-largest endowment in the UK, behind only Cambridge and Oxford. The university occupies five main campuses in the city of Edinburgh, which include many buildings of historical and architectural significance, such as those in the Old Town.\nEdinburgh is the fourth-largest university in the United Kingdom by total enrolment and receives over 66,000 undergraduate applications per year, making it the fifth-most popular university in the UK by application volume. In 2021, Edinburgh had the seventh-highest average UCAS points among British universities for new entrants. The university maintains strong links to the royal family, with Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, serving as its chancellor from 1953 to 2010, and Anne, Princess Royal, holding the position since March 2011.\nNotable alumni of the University of Edinburgh include inventor Alexander Graham Bell, naturalist Charles Darwin, philosopher David Hume, physicist James Clerk Maxwell, and writers such as Oliver Goldsmith, Sir J. M. Barrie, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir Walter Scott, and Robert Louis Stevenson.  The university has produced several heads of state and government, including three British prime ministers. Additionally, three UK Supreme Court justices were educated at Edinburgh. As of October 2024, the university has been affiliated with 20 Nobel Prize laureates, four Pulitzer Prize winners, three Turing Award winners, an Abel Prize laureate, and a Fields Medalist. Edinburgh alumni have also won a total of ten Olympic gold medals.\n\n\n== History ==']","

Westminster Abbey is mentioned in the play Henry VIII by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, when a gentleman describes Anne Boleyn's coronation. The abbey was mentioned in a 1598 sonnet by Thomas Bastard which begins, ""When I behold, with deep astonishment / To famous Westminster how there restort / Living in brass or stony monument / The princes and the worthies of all sort"". Poetry about the abbey has also been written by Francis Beaumont and John Betjeman. The building has appeared in paintings by artists such as Canaletto, Wenceslaus Hollar, William Bruce Ellis Ranken, and J. M. W. Turner.

Thomas Jefferson felt that as far as science was concerned, ""no place in the world can pretend to a competition with Edinburgh"".\n\nIn 1785, Henry Dundas introduced the South Bridge Act in the House of Commons; one of the bill\'s goals was to use South Bridge as a location for the university, which had existed in a hotchpotch of buildings since its establishment. The site was used to construct Old College, the university\'s first custom-built building, by architect William Henry Playfair to plans by Robert Adam. During the 18th century, the university developed a particular forte in teaching anatomy and the developing science of surgery, and it was considered one of the best medical schools in the English-speaking world. Bodies to be used for dissection were brought to the university\'s Anatomy Theatre through a secret tunnel from a nearby house (today\'s College Wynd student accommodation), which was also used by murderers Burke and Hare to deliver the corpses of their victims during the 1820s.\nThe Edinburgh snowball riots of 1838 also known as the \'Wars of the Quadrangle\' occurred when University of Edinburgh students engaged in what started as a snowball fight in ""a spirit of harmless amusement"" before becoming a two-day \'battle\' at Old College with local Edinburgh residents on South Bridge which led to the Lord Provost calling from the 79th regiment to be called from Edinburgh Castle to quell the disturbance. This was later immortalised in a 92-page humorous account written by the students entitled The University Snowdrop and then later, in 1853, in a landscape by English artist, Samuel Bough.\n\nAfter 275 years of governance by the town council, the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858 gave the university full authority over its own affairs. The act established governing bodies including a university court and a general council, and redefined the roles of key officials like the chancellor, rector, and principal.\n\nThe Edinburgh Seven were the first group of matriculated undergraduate female students at any British university. Led by Sophia Jex-Blake, they began studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1869. Although the university blocked them from graduating and qualifying as doctors, their campaign gained national attention and won them many supporters, including Charles Darwin. Their efforts put the rights of women to higher education on the national political agenda, which eventually resulted in legislation allowing women to study at all Scottish universities in 1889. The university admitted women to graduate in medicine in 1893. In 2015, the Edinburgh Seven were commemorated with a plaque at the university, and in 2019 they were posthumously awarded with medical degrees.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, Old College was becoming overcrowded. After a bequest from Sir David Baxter, the university started planning new buildings in earnest. Sir Robert Rowand Anderson won the public architectural competition and was commissioned to design new premises for the Medical School in 1877. Initially, the design incorporated a campanile and a hall for examination and graduation, but this was seen as too ambitious. The new Medical School opened in 1884, but the building was not completed until 1888. After funds were donated by politician and brewer William McEwan in 1894, a separate graduation building was constructed after all, also designed by Anderson. The resulting McEwan Hall on Bristo Square was presented to the university in 1897.\n\nThe Students\' Representative Council (SRC) was founded in 1884 by student Robert Fitzroy Bell. In 1889, the SRC voted to establish Edinburgh University Union (EUU), to be housed in Teviot Row House on Bristo Square. Edinburgh University Sports Union (EUSU) was founded in 1866, and Edinburgh University Women\'s Union (renamed the Chambers Street Union in 1964) in October 1905. The SRC, EUU and Chambers Street Union merged to form Edinburgh University Students\' Association (EUSA) on 1 July 1973.']","

733,=== 21st century ===,"[""=== 21st century ===\nIn the 1990s it became apparent that the old Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place were no longer adequate for a modern teaching hospital. Donald Dewar, the Scottish Secretary at the time, authorized a joint project between private finance, local authorities, and the university to create a modern hospital and medical campus in the Little France area of Edinburgh. The new campus was named the BioQuarter. The Chancellor's Building was opened on 12 August 2002 by Prince Philip, housing the new Edinburgh Medical School alongside the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In 2007, the campus saw the addition of the Euan MacDonald Centre as a research centre for motor neuron diseases, which was part-funded by Scottish entrepreneur Euan MacDonald and his father Donald. In August 2010, author J. K. Rowling provided £10 million in funding to create the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, which was officially opened in October 2013. The Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM) is a stem cell research centre dedicated to the development of regenerative treatments, which was opened in 2012. CRM is also home to applied scientists working with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) and Roslin Cells.\n\nIn December 2002, the Edinburgh Cowgate fire destroyed a number of university buildings, including some 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) of the School of Informatics at 80 South Bridge. This was replaced with the Informatics Forum on Bristo Square, completed in July 2008. Also in 2002, the Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre (ECRC) was opened on the Western General Hospital site. In 2007, the MRC Human Genetics Unit formed a partnership with the Centre for Genomic & Experimental Medicine and the ECRC to create the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine (renamed the Institute of Genetics and Cancer in 2021) on the same site.\nIn April 2008, the Roslin Institute – an animal sciences research centre known for cloning Dolly the sheep – became part of the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies. In 2011, the school moved into a new £60 million building on the Easter Bush campus, which now houses research and teaching facilities, and a hospital for small and farm animals.\n\nEdinburgh College of Art, founded in 1760, formally merged with the university's School of Arts, Culture and Environment on 1 August 2011. In 2014, the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute (ZJE) was founded as an international joint institute offering degrees in biomedical sciences, taught in English. The campus, located in Haining, Zhejiang Province, China, was established on 15 March 2016.\nThe university began hosting a Wikimedian in Residence in 2016. The residency was made into a full-time position in 2019, with the Wikimedian involved in teaching and learning activities within the scope of the University of Edinburgh WikiProject.\nIn 2018, the University of Edinburgh was a signatory to the £1.3 billion Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal, in partnership with the UK and Scottish governments, six local authorities and all universities and colleges in the region. The university committed to delivering a range of economic benefits to the region through the Data-Driven Innovation initiative. In conjunction with Heriot-Watt University, the deal created five innovation hubs: the Bayes Centre, Edinburgh Futures Institute, Usher Institute, Easter Bush, and one further hub based at Heriot-Watt, the National Robotarium. The deal also included creation of the Edinburgh International Data Facility, which performs high-speed data processing in a secure environment.\nIn September 2020, the university completed work on the Richard Verney Health Centre at its central area campus on Bristo Square. The facility houses a health centre and pharmacy, and the university's disability and counselling services. The university's largest expansion in the 2020s was the conversion of some of the historic Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place, which had been vacated in 2003 and partially developed into the Quartermile. The £120 million project created a home for the Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI), an interdisciplinary hub linking arts, humanities, and social sciences with other disciplines in the research and teaching of complex, multi-stakeholder societal challenges. The EFI officially opened its doors to the public on 4 June 2024.""]","
===
The 21st century has seen a significant reshaping of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh's facilities and research focus.  The university has invested heavily in a modern campus designed to accommodate the growth of the healthcare sector, encompassing the BioQuarter, Euan MacDonald Centre, Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, CRM, and more. Key developments include the integration of the Informatics Forum, the establishment of the Institute of Genetics and Cancer, the collaboration with Roslin Institute, the creation of the Edinburgh International Data Facility, and a recent conversion of historic buildings. The university's focus has broadened to include health-focused research and a commitment to regional economic development through initiatives like the Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal.

The significance of the Historical links between Edinburgh and other universities is that Edinburgh's influence is heavily rooted in its historical connections to other universities, especially those of the Medical School. Specifically, its link to Columbia University, Dalhousie University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, McGill University, University of Pennsylvania, and Princeton University, which established and developed institutions elsewhere in the world.  These connections were established through graduates who established and developed universities and colleges, demonstrating Edinburgh's long-standing tradition of educational innovation and collaboration.

738,"What is the primary function of the General Council, according to the provided text?","[""==== General Council ====\nThe General Council consists of graduates, academic staff, current and former University Court members. It was established to ensure that graduates have a continuing voice in the management of the university. The Council is required to meet twice per year to consider matters affecting the wellbeing and prosperity of the university. The Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 gave the Council the power to consider draft ordinances and resolutions, to be presented with an annual report of the work and activities of the university, and to receive an audited financial statement. The Council elects the chancellor of the university and three Assessors on the University Court.\n\n\n==== Senatus Academicus ====\nThe Senatus Academicus is the university's supreme academic body, chaired by the principal and consisting of the professors, heads of departments, and a number of readers, lecturers and other teaching and research staff. The core function of the Senatus is to regulate and supervise the teaching and discipline of the university and to promote research. The Senatus elects four Assessors on the University Court. The Senatus meets three times per year, hosting a presentation and discussion session which is open to all members of staff at each meeting.\n\n\n==== University officials ====\n\nThe university's three most significant officials are its chancellor, rector, and principal, whose rights and responsibilities are largely derived from the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.\nThe office of chancellor serves as the titular head and highest office of the university. Their duties include conferring degrees and enhancing the profile and reputation of the university on national and global levels. The chancellor is elected by the university's General Council, and a person generally remains in the office for life. Previous chancellors include former prime minister Arthur Balfour and novelist Sir J. M. Barrie. Princess Anne has held the position since March 2011 succeeding Prince Philip. She is also Patron of the university's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.\nThe principal is responsible for the overall operation of the university in a chief executive role. The principal is formally nominated by the Curators of Patronage and appointed by the University Court. They are the President of the Senatus Academicus and a member of the University Court ex officio. The principal is also automatically appointed vice-chancellor, in which role they confer degrees on behalf of the chancellor. Previous principals include physicist Sir Edward Appleton and religious philosopher Stewart Sutherland. The current principal is nephrologist Sir Peter Mathieson, who has held the position since February 2018.\nThe office of rector is elected every three years by the staff and matriculated students. The primary role of the rector is to preside at the University Court. The rector also chairs meetings of the General Council in absence of the chancellor. They work closely with students and Edinburgh University Students' Association. Previous rectors include microbiologist Sir Alexander Fleming, and former Prime Ministers Sir Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George. The current rector is activist and writer Simon Fanshawe, who has held the position since March 2024.\n\n\n=== Colleges and schools ===\nIn 2002, the university was reorganised from its nine faculties into three 'Colleges'. While technically not a collegiate university, it comprises the Colleges of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (CAHSS), Science & Engineering (CSE) and Medicine & Vet Medicine (CMVM). Within these colleges are 'Schools', which either represent one academic discipline such as Informatics or assemble adjacent academic disciplines such as the School of History, Classics and Archaeology. While bound by College-level policies, individual Schools can differ in their organisation and governance. As of 2021, the university has 21 schools in total.\n\n\n==== Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences ====\n\nThe College took on its current name of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences in 2016 after absorbing the Edinburgh College of Art in 2011. CAHSS offers more than 280 undergraduate degree programmes, 230 taught postgraduate programmes, and 200 research postgraduate programmes. Twenty subjects offered by the college were ranked within the top 10 nationally in the 2022 Complete University Guide. It includes the oldest English Literature department in Britain, which was ranked 7th globally in the 2021 QS Rankings by Subject in English Language & Literature. The college hosts Scotland's ESRC Doctoral Training Centre (DTC), the Scottish Graduate School of Social Science. The college is the largest of the three colleges by enrolment, with 26,130 students and 3,089 academic staff.""]","

The report strongly suggests that the impact of measures of 'student satisfaction' is a significant factor in Edinburgh’s academic standing.  It explicitly states that, ""Edinburgh was ranked last in the UK for teaching quality in the 2012 National Student Survey, with the 2015 Good University Guide stating that this stemmed from 'questions to do with the promptness, usefulness and extent of academic feedback',"" and that the university “still has a long way to go to turn around a poor position”.

They were married on 29 January 1839 and were the parents of ten children, seven of whom survived to adulthood.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nEmma Wedgwood was born at the family estate of Maer Hall in Maer, Staffordshire, the youngest of seven children of Josiah Wedgwood II and his wife Elizabeth ""Bessie"" (née Allen). Her grandfather Josiah Wedgwood had made his fortune in pottery, and like many others who were not part of the aristocracy, they were nonconformist, belonging to the Unitarian church. Charles Darwin was her first cousin; their shared grandparents were Josiah and Sarah Wedgwood, and as the Wedgwood and Darwin families were closely allied, they had been acquainted since childhood.\nShe was close to her sister Fanny, the two being known by the family as the ""Doveleys"", and was charming and messy, accounting for her nickname, ""Little Miss Slip-Slop"".:\u200a9\u200a She helped her older sister Elizabeth with the Sunday school which was held in Maer Hall laundry, writing simple moral tales to aid instruction and giving 60 village children their only formal training in reading, writing and religion.:\u200a17\u200a\nThe Wedgwoods visited Paris for six months in 1818. Though Emma was only 10 at the time, the strangeness and interest of arriving in France remained in her memory.\nIn January 1822 the 13-year-old Emma and her sister Fanny were taken by their mother for a year at Mrs Mayer\'s school at Greville House, on Paddington Green, London, at what was then the semi-rural village of Paddington.

She grew up at Maer Hall in Staffordshire as the youngest child among seven siblings to Josiah Wedgwood II and Elizabeth ""Bessie"" Allen. Her grandfather, Josiah Wedgwood, had established a successful pottery business, which contributed significantly to their family's wealth. The Wedgwoods were part of the nonconformist Unitarian church, reflecting their status outside the traditional aristocracy.

Emma was closely related to Charles Darwin; they were first cousins and shared grandparents in Josiah and Sarah Wedgwood. This familial connection meant that Emma and Charles had known each other since childhood due to the close ties between the Wedgwood and Darwin families.

In her early life, Emma formed a strong bond with her sister Fanny, together being referred to as the ""Doveleys."" She was described as charming yet somewhat disorganized, earning her the nickname ""Little Miss Slip-Slop."" Emma contributed to her community by assisting her older sister Elizabeth in running a Sunday school at Maer Hall. There, she wrote simple moral tales and provided basic education to 60 village children.

Emma's family traveled extensively during her youth. In 1818, they spent six months in Paris when she was ten years old, an experience that left a lasting impression on her. Later, from January 1822 to the following year, Emma attended Mrs. Mayer's school in London and developed her musical talents, becoming proficient at the piano.

In 1825, Josiah Wedgwood took his daughters on a grand tour of Europe, which included visits to Paris and near Geneva. The family connections extended further when they stayed with their Aunt Jessie (Madame de Sismondi) and later visited her again in Geneva for eight months. During this period, Emma's cousin Caroline Darwin accompanied them, along with Charles Darwin.

Emma was also known for her love of outdoor sports, particularly archery. She played a pivotal role in supporting Charles Darwin during his preparations to embark on the Beagle voyage by helping him overcome familial objections from his father.

Throughout her life, Emma faced personal challenges, including nursing her mother after she suffered a seizure and becoming bedridden. Despite these responsibilities, Emma maintained close relationships with her family and friends, often spending time away from home for extended periods.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4),./data/Emma_Darwin.csv

They were married on 29 January 1839 and were the parents of ten children, seven of whom survived to adulthood.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nEmma Wedgwood was born at the family estate of Maer Hall in Maer, Staffordshire, the youngest of seven children of Josiah Wedgwood II and his wife Elizabeth ""Bessie"" (née Allen). Her grandfather Josiah Wedgwood had made his fortune in pottery, and like many others who were not part of the aristocracy, they were nonconformist, belonging to the Unitarian church. Charles Darwin was her first cousin; their shared grandparents were Josiah and Sarah Wedgwood, and as the Wedgwood and Darwin families were closely allied, they had been acquainted since childhood.\nShe was close to her sister Fanny, the two being known by the family as the ""Doveleys"", and was charming and messy, accounting for her nickname, ""Little Miss Slip-Slop"".:\u200a9\u200a She helped her older sister Elizabeth with the Sunday school which was held in Maer Hall laundry, writing simple moral tales to aid instruction and giving 60 village children their only formal training in reading, writing and religion.:\u200a17\u200a\nThe Wedgwoods visited Paris for six months in 1818.

Emma was by then ""one of the show performers on the piano"", to the extent that on one occasion she was invited along to play for George IV\'s Mrs Fitzherbert.

Her involvement was marked by a blend of personal dedication and social responsibility.

### Involvement in Sunday School Activities

Emma played an active role in the educational and religious life of her community through her participation in Sunday school activities at Maer Hall, the Wedgwood family estate. Alongside her older sister Elizabeth, Emma helped run a Sunday school held in the laundry area of the hall. This initiative was crucial as it provided 60 village children with their only formal education in reading, writing, and religion. Emma contributed by writing simple moral tales to aid instruction, which not only enhanced the educational experience for these children but also reflected her commitment to community service and moral upbringing.

### Role within the Wedgwood Household

Within the Wedgwood household, Emma was an integral part of family life. She was known for being charming yet somewhat disorganized, earning her the affectionate nickname ""Little Miss Slip-Slop."" Her close relationship with her sister Fanny, whom she shared a deep bond with, further highlights her familial role. The sisters were collectively referred to as the ""Doveleys"" by their family.

Emma's responsibilities extended beyond education and household duties; she was also involved in caring for her mother when she became bedridden after suffering a seizure. Emma and her sister Elizabeth took turns nursing their mother, demonstrating their dedication and resilience during challenging times. This caregiving role underscored Emma’s commitment to her family, as she balanced these duties with spending time away from home, staying with friends or relatives.

Overall, Emma Darwin's contributions before her marriage were characterized by a strong sense of duty towards both her immediate family and the broader community, reflecting her nurturing nature and social consciousness.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4),./data/Emma_Darwin.csv
840,"Describe the evolution of Charles Darwin's views on religion as influenced by his marriage to Emma, including how they maintained open communication about their beliefs.","['== Religious views ==\nEmma\'s religious beliefs were founded on Unitarianism, which emphasises inner feeling over the authority of religious texts or doctrine. Her views were not simple and unwavering, and were the result of intensive study and questioning.\nDarwin was open about his scepticism before they became engaged, and she discussed with him the tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Following their marriage, they shared discussions about Christianity for several years. She valued his openness, and his genuine uncertainty regarding the existence and nature of God, which gradually developed into agnosticism. This may have been a bond between them, without necessarily resolving the tensions between their views.\n\nBy early 1837 Charles Darwin was already speculating on transmutation of species. Having decided to marry, he visited Emma on 29 July 1838 and told her of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November 1838, he returned and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote to him: ""When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep out of my head but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviour\'s farewell discourse to his disciples which begins at the end of the 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don\'t wish you to give me your opinion about it.""\nDarwin had already wondered about the materialism implied by his ideas. The letter shows Emma\'s tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Emma cherished a belief in the afterlife, and was concerned that they should ""belong to each other"" for eternity. The passage in the Gospel of John referred to in Emma\'s letter says ""Love one another"" (13:34), then describes Jesus  saying ""I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"" (14:6). Desmond and Moore note that the section continues: ""Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned"" (15:6). As disbelief later gradually crept over Darwin, he could ""hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine.""\nFollowing their marriage in January 1839, they shared discussions about Christianity for many years. They socialised with the Unitarian clergymen James Martineau and John James Tayler, and read their works as well as those of other Unitarian and liberal Anglican authors such as Francis William Newman whose Phases of faith described a spiritual journey from Calvinism to theism, all part of widespread and heated debate on the authority of Anglicanism. In Downe Emma attended the Anglican village church, but as a Unitarian had the family turn round in silence when the Trinitarian Nicene Creed was recited.\nSoon after their marriage, Emma wrote to Charles ""while you are acting conscientiously & sincerely wishing, & trying to learn the truth, you cannot be wrong"", and although concerned at the threat to faith of the ""habit in scientific pursuits of believing nothing till it is proved"", her hope that he did not ""consider his opinion as formed"" proved correct. Methodical conscientious doubt as a state of inquiry rather than disbelief made him open to nature and revelation, and they remained open with each other.']","Charles Darwin's views on religion evolved significantly over time, particularly influenced by his marriage to Emma. Initially, Darwin was already skeptical about religious doctrines before he and Emma became engaged. This skepticism was rooted in his scientific pursuits and the habit of questioning established beliefs until they were proven.

Upon their engagement, Darwin openly discussed his ideas on transmutation of species with Emma, which included materialistic implications that challenged traditional religious views. Emma expressed her concerns about potential differences in their beliefs, particularly regarding Christianity, but she valued Darwin's openness and honesty. This mutual respect for open communication allowed them to discuss their differing views without fear of concealing true opinions.

After their marriage in January 1839, Darwin and Emma continued to engage in discussions about religion. They maintained an environment where they could share ideas freely, despite their differences. Emma cherished her belief in the afterlife and was concerned about belonging together eternally, while Darwin's views gradually shifted towards agnosticism as he found it increasingly difficult to reconcile his scientific understanding with Christian doctrines.

Their social interactions with Unitarian clergymen like James Martineau and John James Tayler, along with reading works by liberal Anglican authors such as Francis William Newman, further fueled their discussions. These engagements exposed them to a spectrum of religious thought, from Calvinism to theism, reflecting the broader debates on Anglicanism's authority.

Emma supported Darwin's conscientious pursuit of truth, emphasizing that his methodical doubt was not disbelief but rather an open inquiry into nature and revelation. This approach allowed Darwin to remain receptive to new ideas while maintaining a respectful dialogue with Emma about their beliefs.

Overall, Charles Darwin's views evolved from skepticism to agnosticism under the influence of his marriage to Emma, characterized by ongoing open communication and mutual respect for each other's perspectives on religion.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4),./data/Emma_Darwin.csv

1. **Organizational Structure**: 
   - The university was organized as a single entity rather than being composed of loosely connected colleges. This centralized organization facilitated academic exchange and collaboration among faculty members, which was crucial for fostering innovative ideas.
   - It adopted a Dutch model of professorship, replacing the regenting system with a more flexible structure where professors specialized in different subjects. This allowed students to learn from multiple experts rather than being taught by a single instructor throughout their studies, promoting a broader and more diverse intellectual environment.

2. **Lack of Land Endowments**:
   - Unlike many other universities that relied on land endowments for income, Edinburgh University operated without such financial security. This lack of guaranteed funding created a competitive atmosphere among faculty members, who were motivated to excel in their fields to attract students and secure their positions.
   - The need to compete for resources likely encouraged innovation and excellence, as professors sought to enhance the university's reputation through groundbreaking research and teaching.

Together, these factors created an environment conducive to intellectual growth and exchange. This setting attracted and nurtured key figures of the Enlightenment, such as Joseph Black, Adam Smith, David Hume, and others, who contributed significantly to various fields of knowledge.

Since the 1930s it has been the home of the School of Divinity. Prior to the 1929 reunion of the Church of Scotland, candidates for the ministry in the United Free Church studied at New College, whilst candidates for the Church of Scotland studied in the university's Faculty of Divinity. In 1935 the two institutions merged, with all operations moved to the New College site in Old Town. This freed up Old College for Edinburgh Law School.\n\nThe Polish School of Medicine was established in 1941 as a wartime academic initiative. While it was originally intended for students and doctors in the Polish Armed Forces in the West, civilians were also allowed to take the courses, which were taught in Polish and awarded Polish medical degrees. When the school was closed in 1949, 336 students had matriculated, of which 227 students graduated with the equivalent of an MBChB and a total of 19 doctors obtained a doctorate or MD. A bronze plaque commemorating the Polish School of Medicine is located in the Quadrangle of the old Medical School in Teviot Place.\nOn 10 May 1951, the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College, founded in 1823 by William Dick, was reconstituted as the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and officially became part of the university. It achieved full faculty status as Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1964.\nIn 1955 the university opened the first department of nursing in Europe for academic study. This department was inspired by the work of Gladys Beaumont Carter and a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.\nBy the end of the 1950s, there were around 7,000 students matriculating annually, more than doubling the numbers from the turn of the century. The university addressed this partially through the redevelopment of George Square, demolishing much of the area's historic houses and erecting modern buildings such as 40 George Square, Appleton Tower and the Main Library.\nOn 1 August 1998, the Moray House Institute of Education, founded in 1848, merged with the University of Edinburgh, becoming its Faculty of Education. Following the internal restructuring of the university in 2002, Moray House became known as the Moray House School of Education. It was renamed the Moray House School of Education and Sport in August 2019.""]","The Polish School of Medicine was established in 1941 as a wartime academic initiative by the University of Edinburgh. Its primary purpose was to provide medical education for students and doctors associated with the Polish Armed Forces in the West during World War II. However, it also extended its offerings to civilians who wished to pursue medical studies.

Courses at the school were conducted in Polish, and upon completion, students received Polish medical degrees. This initiative allowed displaced Polish individuals to continue their education despite the disruptions caused by the war.

The school operated until 1949 when it was closed. During its operation, a total of 336 students matriculated, with 227 graduating with qualifications equivalent to an MBChB (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery). Additionally, 19 doctors achieved higher academic recognition through doctorates or MDs.

To commemorate the contributions and legacy of the Polish School of Medicine, a bronze plaque was installed in the Quadrangle of the old Medical School located at Teviot Place. This serves as a lasting tribute to the institution's role during a challenging period in history.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4),./data/University_of_Edinburgh.csv

Scenes were filmed at the old School of Anatomy.\nMany of Arthur Conan Doyle\'s works drew inspiration from his mentors at the university. Joseph Bell, a lecturer and surgeon famous for drawing conclusions from minute observations, became the archetype for Conan Doyle\'s fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. William Rutherford, Conan Doyle\'s physiology professor provided the template for Professor Challenger, the protagonist of his science fiction work The Lost World (1912). Edinburgh is also Challenger\'s alma mater in the books.\nDr. Fu Manchu, a fictional supervillain created by Sax Rohmer in 1912, stated that ""I am a doctor of philosophy from Edinburgh, a doctor of law from Christ\'s College, a doctor of medicine from Harvard. My friends, out of courtesy, call me \'Doctor\'."" In 2010, Fu Manchu\'s connections with the University where he supposedly obtained a doctorate were investigated in a mockumentary by Miles Jupp (also an Edinburgh alumnus) for BBC Radio 4.\nIn the movie Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959), an adaptation of Jules Verne\'s novel of the same name, the protagonist Sir Oliver Lindenbrook is a Professor of Geology at the university. An early scene where Lindenbrook addresses the students is filmed at the central quadrangle of Old College.\nThe historical film Chariots of Fire (1981) is based on the story of Olympic runner and Edinburgh graduate Eric Liddell, and includes scenes filmed outside of Assembly Hall, New College. Liddell is played by Ian Charleson, who is also an Edinburgh alumnus.\nIn the novel The Last King of Scotland (1998) by Giles Foden, the fictional protagonist Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is a medical doctor recently graduated from Edinburgh. The 2006 film of the same name stars James McAvoy in the role of Dr. Garrigan with the same background.\nIn the American television show NCIS (2003–present), the chief medical examiner, Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard studied medicine at Edinburgh. Ari Haswari, the show\'s main antagonist for the first two seasons, also studied medicine at Edinburgh.\nIn the novel One Day (2009), the lead characters Dexter and Emma both graduated from Edinburgh. A feature film based on the book, also titled One Day and starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess was released in August 2011, with some scenes filmed at the university. A Netflix adaptation of the movie started production in 2021, with filming occurring in the grounds of Old College in 2022.\nThe BBC legal drama Garrow\'s Law (2009–2011) was largely filmed in Edinburgh, despite being set in London. Old College and the Playfair Library are prominently featured.\nThe thriller television series Clique (2017–2019) produced by BBC Three focuses on two students at the university. The series was shot largely on location in Edinburgh, including The Meadows, Old College, and Potterrow.\nFast & Furious 9 (2021), partly set in Edinburgh, featured scenes in and around Old College filmed in September 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==']","The University of Edinburgh has made significant appearances in various works of popular culture, often serving as a backdrop for stories and character development.
