Antiseptic surgery, which was founded by Joseph Lister, revolutionized surgery. Lister’s introduction of antiseptic practices dramatically reduced mortality rates, significantly influencing the direction of medical practice.

It's important to note that this impact was extended to cardiology and oncology, along with the use of mass spectrometry for medical analysis.

The Westminster Abbey is notable for events such as the return of Benedictine monks, the re-establishment of the King James Version of the Bible, and the dramatic events surrounding the Mary I restoration.

The primary reason for the dissolution of Westminster Abbey in 1550 was the monks' attempts to hide the remains of Edward the Confessor, which were being reburied to save them from destruction.

The primary reason for the dissolution of Westminster Abbey in 1550 was due to a complex interplay of religious, political, and economic factors. The reign of King Edward VI, known for his Protestant reforms, spurred a wave of discontent within the Church.  The Abbey, traditionally a center of Catholic worship, was increasingly perceived as a symbol of lingering resistance to Protestant ideas. Henry VIII’s break from Rome fueled this anxiety, as the Abbey’s finances were significantly impacted by the removal of relics and gold.  The dissolution in 1535, although a transitional measure, marked a significant shift towards consolidating Protestant control, and a re-establishment of the monastic order, though still under a largely Catholic monarchy. The Abbey's subsequent relocation to Clerkenwell reflects a broader strategy to control religious institutions.

The Abbey's role in historical events, including the English Civil War, further intensified the anxieties surrounding its future. Its association with the King's Scholars, who were to shout ""Vivat Rex"" during coronations, was viewed with suspicion, and the subsequent damage caused by the war further complicated the situation.  The re-establishment of Westminster as a royal peculiar after the Civil War reinforced a hierarchical structure controlled by the monarch.

The primary reason for the dissolution of Westminster Abbey in 1550 was due to a complex interplay of religious, political, and economic factors. The reign of King Edward VI, known for his Protestant reforms, spurred a wave of discontent within the Church.  The Abbey, traditionally a center of Catholic worship, was increasingly perceived as a symbol of lingering resistance to Protestant ideas. Henry VIII’s break from Rome fueled this anxiety, as the Abbey’s finances were significantly impacted by the removal of relics and gold.  The dissolution in 1535, although a transitional measure, marked a significant shift towards consolidating Protestant control, and a re-establishment of the monastic order, though still under a largely Catholic monarchy. The Abbey's subsequent relocation to Clerkenwell reflects a broader strategy to control religious institutions.

The Abbey's role in historical events, including the English Civil War, further intensified the anxieties surrounding its future. Its association with the King's Scholars, who were to shout ""Vivat Rex"" during coronations, was viewed with suspicion, and the subsequent damage caused by the war further complicated the situation.  The re-establishment of Westminster as a royal peculiar after the Civil War reinforced a hierarchical structure controlled by the monarch. Elizabeth I","

Darwin's intense focus on transmutation research stems from a combination of factors, primarily fueled by his desire to demonstrate the **evolutionary origins of species, and to offer a potential explanation for the diversity of life**. While he was deeply engaged with the biological aspects of nature, his primary goal was to see his research contribute to the **understanding of the natural world**, specifically how species had changed and adapted over time. He believed that *if* species were like plants, then if the underlying principles of variation and adaptation were understood, it would provide a foundation for explaining the observed patterns of life.  He was driven by a scientific curiosity to find a simple explanation for a complex phenomenon. He wanted to prove that the changes he observed could be explained by the natural processes of change, rather than by divine intervention.

Following their marriage, they shared discussions about Christianity for several years. She valued his openness, and his genuine uncertainty regarding the existence and nature of God, which gradually developed into agnosticism. This may have been a bond between them, without necessarily resolving the tensions between their views.\n\nBy early 1837 Charles Darwin was already speculating on transmutation of species. Having decided to marry, he visited Emma on 29 July 1838 and told her of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November 1838, he returned and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote to him: ""When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep out of my head but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviour\'s farewell discourse to his disciples which begins at the end of the 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don\'t wish you to give me your opinion about it.""\nDarwin had already wondered about the materialism implied by his ideas. The letter shows Emma\'s tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Emma cherished a belief in the afterlife, and was concerned that they should ""belong to each other"" for eternity. The passage in the Gospel of John referred to in Emma\'s letter says ""Love one another"" (13:34), then describes Jesus  saying ""I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"" (14:6). Desmond and Moore note that the section continues: ""Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned"" (15:6). As disbelief later gradually crept over Darwin, he could ""hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine.""\nFollowing their marriage in January 1839, they shared discussions about Christianity for many years. They socialised with the Unitarian clergymen James Martineau and John James Tayler, and read their works as well as those of other Unitarian and liberal Anglican authors such as Francis William Newman whose Phases of faith described a spiritual journey from Calvinism to theism, all part of widespread and heated debate on the authority of Anglicanism. In Downe Emma attended the Anglican village church, but as a Unitarian had the family turn round in silence when the Trinitarian Nicene Creed was recited.\nSoon after their marriage, Emma wrote to Charles ""while you are acting conscientiously & sincerely wishing, & trying to learn the truth, you cannot be wrong"", and although concerned at the threat to faith of the ""habit in scientific pursuits of believing nothing till it is proved"", her hope that he did not ""consider his opinion as formed"" proved correct.

Its graduates founded medical schools all over the world, including at five of the seven Ivy League universities (Columbia, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania, and Yale); those in McGill, Montréal, Sydney, and Vermont; the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (now part of Imperial College London), Middlesex Hospital, and the London School of Medicine for Women (both now part of UCL).\nIn the 21st century, the medical school has continued to excel, and it is associated with 13 Nobel Prize recipients: seven recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and six of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 2021, it was ranked third in the UK by The Times University Guide, and the Complete University Guide. In 2022, it was ranked the UK\'s best medical school by the Guardian University Guide,  It also ranked 21st in the world by both the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and the QS World University Rankings in 2021.\nThe Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies is a world leader in veterinary education, research and practice. The eight original faculties formed four Faculty Groups in August 1992. Medicine and Veterinary Medicine became one of these, and in 2002 became the smallest of the three colleges, with 7,740 students and 1,896 academic staff. The university\'s teaching hospitals include the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, St John\'s Hospital, Livingston, Roodlands Hospital, and Royal Hospital for Children and Young People.\n\n\n==== Science and Engineering ====\n\nIn the 16th century, science was taught as ""natural philosophy"" in the university. The 17th century saw the institution of the University Chairs of Mathematics and Botany, followed the next century by Chairs of Natural History, Astronomy, Chemistry and Agriculture. It was Edinburgh\'s professors who took a leading part in the formation of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. Joseph Black, Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the time, founded the world\'s first Chemical Society in 1785. The first named degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Science was instituted in 1864, and a separate Faculty of Science was created in 1893 after three centuries of scientific advances at Edinburgh. The Regius Chair in Engineering was established in 1868, and the Regius Chair in Geology in 1871. In 1991 the Faculty of Science was renamed the Faculty of Science and Engineering, and in 2002 it became the College of Science and Engineering.

The south transept, located in the south of the abbey, is a semicircular structure that partially divides the building.

Here's why:
*   It was built between 1250 and 1259, aligning with the period when the abbey was being constructed.
*   The text explicitly states that it ""overhangs the western cloister,"" indicating a function related to light and a central architectural element.
*   The text does not provide specific details about its function, and only that it was part of the architecture of the abbey.

Final Answer: The final answer is: 
The south transept was a semicircular structure that partially divided the building, a feature that reflected the abbey’s architectural design and allowed light to enter from the west.

The Holyrood campus serves as the principal research and education centre for the Scottish Highlands and Islands, encompassing various faculties and departments. It is a key institution at the University of Edinburgh, offering a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate studies. The campus's evolution reflects a shift from a primarily government-funded research facility to a dynamic hub supporting diverse disciplines. The initial focus was on environmental science, maritime management, and community development, but has expanded to include biomedical sciences, data-driven innovation, and international collaboration. Significant developments include the establishment of the 20th-century satellite campus specializing in the sciences, the formation of the Edinburgh University Union and Chambers Street Union, the establishment of the University's Student Representative Council, and the subsequent integration of the Polish School of Medicine. Notably, the University's commitment to innovation is evident in recent developments such as the Richard Verney Health Centre, the Quentin Black Building, and the development of the Edinburgh International Data Facility. The campus's strategic location, combined with the University's investment in new facilities and research, has cemented its position as a leading centre for higher education and research within the Highlands and Islands.

We have the opportunity to refine the existing answer (only if needed) with some more context below.","

Darwin’s work had a profound influence on the evolution of scientific thought by demonstrating the power of integrating multiple observations and theories into a unified framework. By showcasing the principle of natural selection as a key mechanism of evolutionary change, he spurred a shift from alternative explanations for evolutionary processes to a robust and widely accepted theory. The influence of Darwin's work went far beyond simply proposing evolution; it revolutionized the entire study of nature and inspired countless scientists to build upon his foundational insights.

Darwin’s work had a profound influence on the evolution of scientific thought by demonstrating the power of integrating multiple observations and theories into a unified framework. By showcasing the principle of natural selection as a key mechanism of evolutionary change, he spurred a shift from alternative explanations for evolutionary processes to a robust and widely accepted theory. The influence of Darwin's work went far beyond simply proposing evolution; it revolutionized the entire study of nature and inspired countless scientists to build upon his foundational insights.

"What is the central argument of Malthus's essay on Population, according to Darwin?","['=== Malthus and natural selection ===\nContinuing his research in London, Darwin\'s wide reading now included the sixth edition of Malthus\'s An Essay on the Principle of Population. On 28 September 1838, he noted its assertion that human ""population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty-five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio"", a geometric progression so that population soon exceeds food supply in what is known as a Malthusian catastrophe. Darwin was well-prepared to compare this to Augustin de Candolle\'s ""warring of the species"" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the ""final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, & adapt it to changes"", so that ""One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying [to] force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones."" This would result in the formation of new species. As he later wrote in his Autobiography:\n\nIn October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work...\nBy mid-December, Darwin saw a similarity between farmers picking the best stock in selective breeding, and a Malthusian Nature selecting from chance variants so that ""every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected"", thinking this comparison ""a beautiful part of my theory"". He later called his theory natural selection, an analogy with what he termed the ""artificial selection"" of selective breeding.\nOn 11 November, he returned to Maer and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas. She accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, while expressing her strong Unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife. While he was house-hunting in London, bouts of illness continued and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking ""So don\'t be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you."" He found what they called ""Macaw Cottage"" (because of its gaudy interiors) in Gower Street, then moved his ""museum"" in over Christmas. On 24 January 1839, Darwin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).\nOn 29 January, Darwin and Emma Wedgwood were married at Maer in an Anglican ceremony arranged to suit the Unitarians, then immediately caught the train to London and their new home.']","

"What was the primary tension faced by Emma and Charles Darwin throughout their marriage, and how did they address these tensions?","['== Religious views ==\nEmma\'s religious beliefs were founded on Unitarianism, which emphasises inner feeling over the authority of religious texts or doctrine. Her views were not simple and unwavering, and were the result of intensive study and questioning.\nDarwin was open about his scepticism before they became engaged, and she discussed with him the tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Following their marriage, they shared discussions about Christianity for several years. She valued his openness, and his genuine uncertainty regarding the existence and nature of God, which gradually developed into agnosticism. This may have been a bond between them, without necessarily resolving the tensions between their views.\n\nBy early 1837 Charles Darwin was already speculating on transmutation of species. Having decided to marry, he visited Emma on 29 July 1838 and told her of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November 1838, he returned and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote to him: ""When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep out of my head but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviour\'s farewell discourse to his disciples which begins at the end of the 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don\'t wish you to give me your opinion about it.""\nDarwin had already wondered about the materialism implied by his ideas. The letter shows Emma\'s tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Emma cherished a belief in the afterlife, and was concerned that they should ""belong to each other"" for eternity. The passage in the Gospel of John referred to in Emma\'s letter says ""Love one another"" (13:34), then describes Jesus  saying ""I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"" (14:6). Desmond and Moore note that the section continues: ""Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned"" (15:6). As disbelief later gradually crept over Darwin, he could ""hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine.""\nFollowing their marriage in January 1839, they shared discussions about Christianity for many years. They socialised with the Unitarian clergymen James Martineau and John James Tayler, and read their works as well as those of other Unitarian and liberal Anglican authors such as Francis William Newman whose Phases of faith described a spiritual journey from Calvinism to theism, all part of widespread and heated debate on the authority of Anglicanism. In Downe Emma attended the Anglican village church, but as a Unitarian had the family turn round in silence when the Trinitarian Nicene Creed was recited.\nSoon after their marriage, Emma wrote to Charles ""while you are acting conscientiously & sincerely wishing, & trying to learn the truth, you cannot be wrong"", and although concerned at the threat to faith of the ""habit in scientific pursuits of believing nothing till it is proved"", her hope that he did not ""consider his opinion as formed"" proved correct. Methodical conscientious doubt as a state of inquiry rather than disbelief made him open to nature and revelation, and they remained open with each other.']","
The primary tension faced by Emma and Charles Darwin throughout their marriage was between her deep-seated belief in the afterlife, and her concern for their eternal connection in heaven. This was exacerbated by her fear that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. They addressed these tensions through open discussions about Christianity, reading works by Unitarian and liberal Anglican authors, and engaging in social activities with Unitarian clergymen.
",ai (google/gemma-3-1b-it),ai (google/gemma-3-1b-it),./data/Emma_Darwin_gemma.csv,"

Emma and Charles Darwin faced a primary tension in their marriage due to Charles's tendency towards intellectual solitude and his insistence on meticulous, solitary research, which deeply affected Emma's need for emotional connection and personal expression. This contrasted with Emma's desire for shared experiences, a cozy home life, and emotional intimacy, and created a sense of distance and frustration between them. They attempted to resolve these tensions through several methods, primarily focusing on communication, compromise, and a mutual understanding of their individual needs. Emma advocated for more frequent social interaction, while Charles, often resistant to change, suggested a return to more solitary activities.

Her views were not simple and unwavering, and were the result of intensive study and questioning.\nDarwin was open about his scepticism before they became engaged, and she discussed with him the tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Following their marriage, they shared discussions about Christianity for several years. She valued his openness, and his genuine uncertainty regarding the existence and nature of God, which gradually developed into agnosticism. This may have been a bond between them, without necessarily resolving the tensions between their views.\n\nBy early 1837 Charles Darwin was already speculating on transmutation of species. Having decided to marry, he visited Emma on 29 July 1838 and told her of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November 1838, he returned and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote to him: ""When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep out of my head but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviour\'s farewell discourse to his disciples which begins at the end of the 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don\'t wish you to give me your opinion about it.""\nDarwin had already wondered about the materialism implied by his ideas. The letter shows Emma\'s tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Emma cherished a belief in the afterlife, and was concerned that they should ""belong to each other"" for eternity. The passage in the Gospel of John referred to in Emma\'s letter says ""Love one another"" (13:34), then describes Jesus  saying ""I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"" (14:6). Desmond and Moore note that the section continues: ""Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned"" (15:6). As disbelief later gradually crept over Darwin, he could ""hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine.""\nFollowing their marriage in January 1839, they shared discussions about Christianity for many years. They socialised with the Unitarian clergymen James Martineau and John James Tayler, and read their works as well as those of other Unitarian and liberal Anglican authors such as Francis William Newman whose Phases of faith described a spiritual journey from Calvinism to theism, all part of widespread and heated debate on the authority of Anglicanism. In Downe Emma attended the Anglican village church, but as a Unitarian had the family turn round in silence when the Trinitarian Nicene Creed was recited.\nSoon after their marriage, Emma wrote to Charles ""while you are acting conscientiously & sincerely wishing, & trying to learn the truth, you cannot be wrong"", and although concerned at the threat to faith of the ""habit in scientific pursuits of believing nothing till it is proved"", her hope that he did not ""consider his opinion as formed"" proved correct. Methodical conscientious doubt as a state of inquiry rather than disbelief made him open to nature and revelation, and they remained open with each other.']","
The primary tension faced by Emma and Charles Darwin throughout their marriage was between her deep-seated belief in the afterlife, and her concern for their eternal connection in heaven. This was exacerbated by her fear that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. They addressed these tensions through open discussions about Christianity, reading works by Unitarian and liberal Anglican authors, and engaging in social activities with Unitarian clergymen.

Emma and Charles Darwin faced a primary tension in their marriage due to Charles's tendency towards intellectual solitude and his insistence on meticulous, solitary research, which deeply affected Emma's need for emotional connection and personal expression. This contrasted with Emma's desire for shared experiences, a cozy home life, and emotional intimacy, and created a sense of distance and frustration between them. They attempted to resolve these tensions through several methods, primarily focusing on communication, compromise, and a mutual understanding of their individual needs. Emma advocated for more frequent social interaction, while Charles, often resistant to change, suggested a return to more solitary activities. Ultimately, they learned to value each other's perspectives, recognizing the importance of their contrasting personalities and the unique contributions they each brought to the relationship.

"How did Darwin's upbringing and family influence his views on social and political issues, specifically regarding slavery, and his interactions with indigenous populations?","['=== Human society ===\nDarwin\'s views on social and political issues reflected his time and social position. He grew up in a family of Whig reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported electoral reform and the emancipation of slaves. Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants.\nTaking taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave John Edmonstone, whom Darwin long recalled as ""a very pleasant and intelligent man"", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the Beagle voyage. Though commonplace in Britain at the time, Silliman and Bachman noticed the contrast with slave-owning America. Around twenty years later, racism became a feature of British society, but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against ""ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species"", and against ill-treatment of native people.[VII]\nDarwin\'s interaction with Yaghans (Fuegians) such as Jemmy Button during the second voyage of HMS Beagle had a profound impact on his view of indigenous peoples. At his arrival in Tierra del Fuego he made a colourful description of ""Fuegian savages"". This view changed as he came to know Yaghan people more in detail. By studying the Yaghans, Darwin concluded that a number of basic emotions by different human groups were the same and that mental capabilities were roughly the same as for Europeans. While interested in Yaghan culture, Darwin failed to appreciate their deep ecological knowledge and elaborate cosmology until the 1850s when he inspected a dictionary of Yaghan detailing 32,000 words. He saw that European colonisation would often lead to the extinction of native civilisations, and ""tr[ied] to integrate colonialism into an evolutionary history of civilization analogous to natural history"".\nDarwin\'s view of women was that men\'s eminence over them was the outcome of sexual selection, a view disputed by Antoinette Brown Blackwell in her 1875 book The Sexes Throughout Nature.\nDarwin was intrigued by his half-cousin Francis Galton\'s argument, introduced in 1865, that statistical analysis of heredity showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. In The Descent of Man, Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, ""the noblest part of our nature"", and factors such as education could be more important. When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a ""caste"" of ""those who are naturally gifted"", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties and thought it ""the sole feasible, yet I fear utopian, plan of procedure in improving the human race"", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals.

Darwin's upbringing and family significantly influenced his views on social and political issues, particularly regarding slavery, through several key avenues:

1.  **Early Exposure to Racial Inequality:** Darwin's father, Charles Darwin, was a clergyman and a staunch defender of racial hierarchy. He actively promoted the idea that certain races were inherently superior to others, including Africans. This deeply instilled in Darwin a negative view of racial inferiority and fostered a sense of discomfort with any societal practice that perpetuated such inequalities.
2.  **Family's Advocacy of Colonialism:** Darwin's mother, Elizabeth Darwin, was a passionate advocate for colonial expansion. She believed that spreading Christianity and European culture was a moral imperative and that this required the subjugation of indigenous populations. This reinforced Darwin's belief in the justification of colonialism.
3.  **Influence on Philosophical and Scientific Thinking:** Darwin's family's views had a profound impact on his developing philosophical and scientific thinking. The emphasis on order and the hierarchical structure, as reflected in his family's beliefs, encouraged him to see societies as systems with clear hierarchies and a need for control.

Darwin's upbringing and family influence his views on social and political issues in several ways. His family tradition, particularly his father's religious perspective, shaped his worldview, which included views on social hierarchy and racial distinctions. He often expressed observations on the social status of individuals within his family, especially his brother, and, most notably, the family's traditional disapproval of slavery.  The family’s emphasis on a moral foundation, through religious principles, likely influenced his desire to pursue a scientific understanding of the world, and contributed to his evolving perspectives on social justice.  He also interacted with indigenous populations, and his observations on them revealed his deep interest in the complexities of human interactions. While not directly advocating for their liberation, his research and observations of indigenous communities, combined with his broader focus on understanding human behavior and the natural world, fostered an awareness of the interconnectedness of humanity and the importance of respecting diverse cultures. He was skeptical of the prevailing notions of racial hierarchy based on his observations, recognizing that biological differences were an illusion compared to the ways of life and contributions of different populations.

"According to Darwin, what did the book conclude about the nature of life, highlighting the concept of evolution and the end of a few forms being ""evolved"" into many?","['At the end of the book, he concluded that:\n\nThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\nThe last word was the only variant of ""evolved"" in the first five editions of the book. ""Evolutionism"" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with embryological development. Darwin first used the word evolution in The Descent of Man in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of The Origin of Species.\n\n\n=== Responses to publication ===\n\nThe book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular and less scientific Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. Though Darwin\'s illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and corresponded on it with colleagues worldwide. The book did not explicitly discuss human origins,[IV] but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made.\nThe first review asked, ""If a monkey has become a man – what may not a man become?"" It said this should be left to theologians as being too dangerous for ordinary readers. Among early favourable responses, Huxley\'s reviews swiped at Richard Owen, leader of the scientific establishment which Huxley was trying to overthrow.\nIn April, Owen\'s review attacked Darwin\'s friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin, but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution. Patrick Matthew drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.\nThe Church of England\'s response was mixed. Darwin\'s old Cambridge tutors Sedgwick and Henslow dismissed the ideas, but liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God\'s design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as ""just as noble a conception of Deity"". In 1860, the publication of Essays and Reviews by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted clerical attention from Darwin. Its ideas, including higher criticism, were attacked by church authorities as heresy. In it, Baden Powell argued that miracles broke God\'s laws, so belief in them was atheistic, and praised ""Mr Darwin\'s masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature"".\nAsa Gray discussed teleology with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray\'s pamphlet on theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with natural theology. The most famous confrontation was at the public 1860 Oxford evolution debate during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, though not opposed to transmutation of species, argued against Darwin\'s explanation and human descent from apes. Joseph Hooker argued strongly for Darwin, and Thomas Huxley\'s legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.\nEven Darwin\'s close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education, aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. Owen\'s claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate biological order from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long-running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the ""Great Hippocampus Question"", and discredited Owen.\nIn response to objections that the origin of life was unexplained, Darwin pointed to acceptance of Newton\'s law even though the cause of gravity was unknown. Despite criticisms and reservations related to this topic, he nevertheless proposed a prescient idea in an 1871 letter to Hooker in which he suggested the origin of life may have occurred in a ""warm little pond"".\nDarwinism became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863, Lyell\'s Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin.']","
According to Darwin, the book concluded that there is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.

""Evolutionism"" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with embryological development. Darwin first used the word evolution in The Descent of Man in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of The Origin of Species.\n\n\n=== Responses to publication ===\n\nThe book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular and less scientific Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. Though Darwin\'s illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and corresponded on it with colleagues worldwide. The book did not explicitly discuss human origins,[IV] but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made.\nThe first review asked, ""If a monkey has become a man – what may not a man become?"" It said this should be left to theologians as being too dangerous for ordinary readers. Among early favourable responses, Huxley\'s reviews swiped at Richard Owen, leader of the scientific establishment which Huxley was trying to overthrow.\nIn April, Owen\'s review attacked Darwin\'s friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin, but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution. Patrick Matthew drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.\nThe Church of England\'s response was mixed. Darwin\'s old Cambridge tutors Sedgwick and Henslow dismissed the ideas, but liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God\'s design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as ""just as noble a conception of Deity"". In 1860, the publication of Essays and Reviews by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted clerical attention from Darwin. Its ideas, including higher criticism, were attacked by church authorities as heresy. In it, Baden Powell argued that miracles broke God\'s laws, so belief in them was atheistic, and praised ""Mr Darwin\'s masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature"".\nAsa Gray discussed teleology with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray\'s pamphlet on theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with natural theology. The most famous confrontation was at the public 1860 Oxford evolution debate during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, though not opposed to transmutation of species, argued against Darwin\'s explanation and human descent from apes. Joseph Hooker argued strongly for Darwin, and Thomas Huxley\'s legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.\nEven Darwin\'s close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education, aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. Owen\'s claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate biological order from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long-running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the ""Great Hippocampus Question"", and discredited Owen.\nIn response to objections that the origin of life was unexplained, Darwin pointed to acceptance of Newton\'s law even though the cause of gravity was unknown. Despite criticisms and reservations related to this topic, he nevertheless proposed a prescient idea in an 1871 letter to Hooker in which he suggested the origin of life may have occurred in a ""warm little pond"".\nDarwinism became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863, Lyell\'s Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin.']","

"How did Edward the Confessor's rebuilding of Saint Peter's Abbey begin, and what was the primary purpose behind the project?","['=== Edward the Confessor\'s abbey ===\nBetween 1042 and 1052, Edward the Confessor began rebuilding Saint Peter\'s Abbey to provide himself with a royal burial church. It was built in the Romanesque style and was the first church in England built on a cruciform floorplan. The master stonemason for the project was Leofsi Duddason, with Godwin and Wendelburh Gretsyd (meaning ""fat purse"") as patrons, and Teinfrith as ""churchwright"", probably meaning someone who worked on the carpentry and roofing. Endowments from Edward supported a community that increased from a dozen monks during Dunstan\'s time, to as many as 80. The building was completed around 1060 and was consecrated on 28 December 1065, about a week before Edward\'s death on 5 January 1066. A week later, he was buried in the church; nine years later, his wife Edith was buried alongside him. His successor, Harold Godwinson, was probably crowned here, although the first documented coronation is that of William the Conqueror later that year.\nThe only extant depiction of Edward\'s abbey is in the Bayeux Tapestry. The foundations still survive under the present church, and above ground, some of the lower parts of the monastic dormitory survive in the undercroft, including a door said to come from the previous Anglo-Saxon abbey. It was a little smaller than the current church, with a central tower.\nIn 1103, thirty-seven years after his death, Edward\'s tomb was re-opened by Abbot Gilbert Crispin and Henry I, who discovered that his body was still in perfect condition. This was considered proof of his saintliness, and he was canonised in 1161. Two years later he was moved to a new shrine, during which time his ring was removed and placed in the abbey\'s collection.\nThe abbey became more closely associated with royalty from the second half of the 12th century, as kings increasingly used the nearby Palace of Westminster as the seat of their governments. In 1222, the abbey was officially granted exemption from the Bishop of London\'s jurisdiction, making it answerable only to the head of the Church itself. By this time, the abbey owned a large swath of land around it, from modern-day Oxford Street to the Thames, plus entire parishes in the City of London, such as St Alban, Wood Street and St Magnus the Martyr, as well as several wharfs.\nOutside London, the abbey owned estates across southeast England, including in Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Essex, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. The abbot was also the lord of the manor in Westminster, as a town of two to three thousand people grew around the abbey. As a consumer and employer on a grand scale, the abbey helped fuel the town\'s economy, and relations with the town remained unusually cordial, but no enfranchising charter was issued during the Middle Ages.']","

The original query is as follows: How did Edward the Confessor's rebuilding of Saint Peter's Abbey begin, and what was the primary purpose behind the project?
We have provided an existing answer: 
Edward the Confessor's rebuilding of Saint Peter's Abbey began in 1376, with the donations of large sums from Abbot Nicholas Litlyngton and Richard II. The primary purpose behind the project was to finish the church, which was now over 100 years out of date. Richard II donated large sums to finish the church. Henry V, disappointed with the abbey's unfinished state, gave extra funds towards the rebuilding. In his will, he left instructions.

The master stonemason for the project was Leofsi Duddason, with Godwin and Wendelburh Gretsyd (meaning ""fat purse"") as patrons, and Teinfrith as ""churchwright"", probably meaning someone who worked on the carpentry and roofing. Endowments from Edward supported a community that increased from a dozen monks during Dunstan\'s time, to as many as 80. The building was completed around 1060 and was consecrated on 28 December 1065, about a week before Edward\'s death on 5 January 1066. A week later, he was buried in the church; nine years later, his wife Edith was buried alongside him. His successor, Harold Godwinson, was probably crowned here, although the first documented coronation is that of William the Conqueror later that year.\nThe only extant depiction of Edward\'s abbey is in the Bayeux Tapestry. The foundations still survive under the present church, and above ground, some of the lower parts of the monastic dormitory survive in the undercroft, including a door said to come from the previous Anglo-Saxon abbey. It was a little smaller than the current church, with a central tower.\nIn 1103, thirty-seven years after his death, Edward\'s tomb was re-opened by Abbot Gilbert Crispin and Henry I, who discovered that his body was still in perfect condition. This was considered proof of his saintliness, and he was canonised in 1161. Two years later he was moved to a new shrine, during which time his ring was removed and placed in the abbey\'s collection.\nThe abbey became more closely associated with royalty from the second half of the 12th century, as kings increasingly used the nearby Palace of Westminster as the seat of their governments. In 1222, the abbey was officially granted exemption from the Bishop of London\'s jurisdiction, making it answerable only to the head of the Church itself. By this time, the abbey owned a large swath of land around it, from modern-day Oxford Street to the Thames, plus entire parishes in the City of London, such as St Alban, Wood Street and St Magnus the Martyr, as well as several wharfs.\nOutside London, the abbey owned estates across southeast England, including in Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Essex, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. The abbot was also the lord of the manor in Westminster, as a town of two to three thousand people grew around the abbey. As a consumer and employer on a grand scale, the abbey helped fuel the town\'s economy, and relations with the town remained unusually cordial, but no enfranchising charter was issued during the Middle Ages.']","

The original query is as follows: How did Edward the Confessor's rebuilding of Saint Peter's Abbey begin, and what was the primary purpose behind the project?
We have provided an existing answer: 
Edward the Confessor's rebuilding of Saint Peter's Abbey began in 1376, with the donations of large sums from Abbot Nicholas Litlyngton and Richard II. The primary purpose behind the project was to finish the church, which was now over 100 years out of date. Richard II donated large sums to finish the church. Henry V, disappointed with the abbey's unfinished state, gave extra funds towards the rebuilding. In his will, he left instructions.
We have the opportunity to refine the existing answer (only if needed) with some more context below.

"What was the initial reaction of other members of the crew (particularly the Fuegians) to Darwin’s arrival on the ship, and how did this impact the voyage's progress?","['=== Survey voyage on HMS Beagle ===\n\nAfter leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a few days with student friends at Barmouth. He returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) naturalist for a self-funded supernumerary place on HMS Beagle with captain Robert FitzRoy, a position for a gentleman rather than ""a mere collector"". The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America. Robert Darwin objected to his son\'s planned two-year voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, Josiah Wedgwood II, to agree to (and fund) his son\'s participation. Darwin took care to remain in a private capacity to retain control over his collection, intending it for a major scientific institution.\nAfter delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations. At intervals during the voyage, his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas, was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected during a calm spell.\n\nOn their first stop ashore at St Jago in Cape Verde, Darwin found that a white band high in the volcanic rock cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of Charles Lyell\'s Principles of Geology, which set out uniformitarian concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,[II] and Darwin saw things Lyell\'s way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology. When they reached Brazil, Darwin was delighted by the tropical forest, but detested the sight of slavery there, and disputed this issue with FitzRoy.\nThe survey continued to the south in Patagonia. They stopped at Bahía Blanca, and in cliffs near Punta Alta Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct mammals beside modern seashells, indicating recent extinction with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He found bony plates like a giant version of the armour on local armadillos. From a jaw and tooth he identified the gigantic Megatherium, then from Cuvier\'s description thought the armour was from this animal. The finds were shipped to England, and scientists found the fossils of great interest. In Patagonia, Darwin came to wrongly believe the territory was devoid of reptiles.\nOn rides with gauchos into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, Darwin gained social, political and anthropological insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of rhea had separate but overlapping territories. Further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as raised beaches at a series of elevations. He read Lyell\'s second volume and accepted its view of ""centres of creation"" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell\'s ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.\nThree Fuegians on board, who had been seized during the first Beagle voyage then given Christian education in England, were returning with a missionary. Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at Tierra del Fuego he met ""miserable, degraded savages"", as different as wild from domesticated animals. He remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with a shared origin and potential for improvement towards civilisation. Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. A year on, the mission had been abandoned. The Fuegian they had named Jemmy Button lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.\n\nDarwin experienced an earthquake in Chile in 1835 and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including mussel-beds stranded above high tide. High in the Andes he saw seashells and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, oceanic islands sank, and coral reefs round them grew to form atolls.\nOn the geologically new Galápagos Islands, Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older ""centre of creation"", and found mockingbirds allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island.']","
The initial reaction of other members of the crew, particularly the Fuegians, to Darwin's arrival was mixed. While most were initially friendly and civilised, the Fuegians, who had been seized during the first Beagle voyage, were often seen as different from domesticated animals. They were viewed with suspicion and a degree of pity by the crew, who recognised their past hardships and treated them with a degree of compassion, yet the presence of these diverse native peoples presented challenges to Darwin's plans for scientific observation and integration. Their presence disrupted the established routine and forced the crew to reconsider their strategies for scientific study.

A Marking and Assessment Boycott that commenced on 20 April 2023 was called off on 6 September 2023. However, the UCU voted to continue strike action throughout the rest of September.\nIn November 2024, Principal Mathieson warned staff of impending redundancies, citing ""a multi-million pound increase to our salary bill"" he said had been created by the Labour administration\'s National Insurance hike. Following Mathieson\'s announcement of £140 million in cuts on 25 February 2025, the UCU said that 59% of its members had turned out for a consulative ballot, with 75% willing to strike, and a further 10% prepared to work to rule including refusing to cover for absent colleagues. Mathieson\'s annual salary package exceeding £418,000 and comparable remunerations of other university executive staff also fell under heavy criticism in light of cuts staff were being asked to absorb.\n\n\n== Academic profile ==\nThe university is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, and the Sutton 13 group of top-ranked universities in the UK. It is the only British university to be a member of both the Coimbra Group and the League of European Research Universities, and it is a founding member of Una Europa and Universitas 21, both international associations of research-intensive universities. The university maintains historically strong ties with the neighbouring Heriot-Watt University for teaching and research. Edinburgh also offers a wide range of free online MOOC courses on three global platforms Coursera, Edx and FutureLearn.\n\n\n=== Admissions ===\n\nIn 2021, the University of Edinburgh had the seventh-highest average entry standards amongst universities in the UK, with new undergraduates averaging 197 UCAS points, equivalent to just above AAAA in A-level grades. It gave offers of admission to 33% of its 18 year old applicants in 2022, the fourth-lowest amongst the Russell Group.\nIn 2022, excluding courses within Edinburgh College of Art, the most competitive courses for Scottish applicants were Oral Health Science (9%), Business (11%), Philosophy & Psychology (14%), Social Work (15%), and International Business (15%). For students from the rest of the UK, the most competitive courses were Nursing (5%), Medicine (6%), Veterinary Medicine (6%), Psychology (8%), and Politics, Philosophy and Economics (10%). For international students, the most competitive courses were Medicine (5%), Nursing (7%), Business (11%), Politics, Philosophy and\nEconomics (12%), and Sociology (13%).\nFor the academic year 2019/20, 36.8% of Edinburgh\'s new undergraduates were privately educated, the second-highest proportion among mainstream British universities, behind only Oxford. As of August 2021, it has a higher proportion of female than male students with a male to female ratio of 38:62 in the undergraduate population, and the undergraduate student body is composed of 30% Scottish students, 32% from the rest of the UK, 10% from the EU, and 28% from outside the EU.\n\n\n=== Graduation ===\n\nAt graduation ceremonies, graduates are being \'capped\' with the Geneva bonnet, which involves the university\'s principal tapping them on the head with the cap while they receive their graduation certificate. The velvet-and-silk hat has been used for over 150 years, and legend says that it was originally made from cloth taken from the breeches of 16th-century scholars John Knox or George Buchanan. However, when the hat was last restored in the early 2000s, a label dated 1849 was discovered bearing the name of Edinburgh tailor Henry Banks, although some doubt remains whether he manufactured or restored the hat. In 2006, a university emblem that had been taken into space by astronaut and Edinburgh graduate Piers Sellers was incorporated into the Geneva bonnet.\n\n\n=== Library system ===\n\nPre-dating the university by three years, Edinburgh University Library was founded in 1580 through the donation of a large collection by Clement Litill, and today is the largest academic library collection in Scotland.

A Marking and Assessment Boycott that commenced on 20 April 2023 was called off on 6 September 2023. However, the UCU voted to continue strike action throughout the rest of September.\nIn November 2024, Principal Mathieson warned staff of impending redundancies, citing ""a multi-million pound increase to our salary bill"" he said had been created by the Labour administration\'s National Insurance hike. Following Mathieson\'s announcement of £140 million in cuts on 25 February 2025, the UCU said that 59% of its members had turned out for a consulative ballot, with 75% willing to strike, and a further 10% prepared to work to rule including refusing to cover for absent colleagues. Mathieson\'s annual salary package exceeding £418,000 and comparable remunerations of other university executive staff also fell under heavy criticism in light of cuts staff were being asked to absorb.\n\n\n== Academic profile ==\nThe university is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, and the Sutton 13 group of top-ranked universities in the UK. It is the only British university to be a member of both the Coimbra Group and the League of European Research Universities, and it is a founding member of Una Europa and Universitas 21, both international associations of research-intensive universities. The university maintains historically strong ties with the neighbouring Heriot-Watt University for teaching and research. Edinburgh also offers a wide range of free online MOOC courses on three global platforms Coursera, Edx and FutureLearn.\n\n\n=== Admissions ===\n\nIn 2021, the University of Edinburgh had the seventh-highest average entry standards amongst universities in the UK, with new undergraduates averaging 197 UCAS points, equivalent to just above AAAA in A-level grades. It gave offers of admission to 33% of its 18 year old applicants in 2022, the fourth-lowest amongst the Russell Group.\nIn 2022, excluding courses within Edinburgh College of Art, the most competitive courses for Scottish applicants were Oral Health Science (9%), Business (11%), Philosophy & Psychology (14%), Social Work (15%), and International Business (15%). For students from the rest of the UK, the most competitive courses were Nursing (5%), Medicine (6%), Veterinary Medicine (6%), Psychology (8%), and Politics, Philosophy and Economics (10%). For international students, the most competitive courses were Medicine (5%), Nursing (7%), Business (11%), Politics, Philosophy and\nEconomics (12%), and Sociology (13%).\nFor the academic year 2019/20, 36.8% of Edinburgh\'s new undergraduates were privately educated, the second-highest proportion among mainstream British universities, behind only Oxford. As of August 2021, it has a higher proportion of female than male students with a male to female ratio of 38:62 in the undergraduate population, and the undergraduate student body is composed of 30% Scottish students, 32% from the rest of the UK, 10% from the EU, and 28% from outside the EU.\n\n\n=== Graduation ===\n\nAt graduation ceremonies, graduates are being \'capped\' with the Geneva bonnet, which involves the university\'s principal tapping them on the head with the cap while they receive their graduation certificate. The velvet-and-silk hat has been used for over 150 years, and legend says that it was originally made from cloth taken from the breeches of 16th-century scholars John Knox or George Buchanan. However, when the hat was last restored in the early 2000s, a label dated 1849 was discovered bearing the name of Edinburgh tailor Henry Banks, although some doubt remains whether he manufactured or restored the hat. In 2006, a university emblem that had been taken into space by astronaut and Edinburgh graduate Piers Sellers was incorporated into the Geneva bonnet.\n\n\n=== Library system ===\n\nPre-dating the university by three years, Edinburgh University Library was founded in 1580 through the donation of a large collection by Clement Litill, and today is the largest academic library collection in Scotland. The Brutalist style eight-storey Main Library building in George Square was designed by Sir Basil Spence. At the time of its completion in 1967, it was the largest building of its type in the UK, and today is a category A listed building. The library system also includes many specialised libraries at the college and school level.']","

"Beyond weddings, what other significant events occurred at Westminster Abbey?","[""=== Weddings ===\nAt least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey. Royal weddings at the abbey were relatively rare before the 20th century, with royals often married in a Chapel Royal or at Windsor Castle; this changed with the 1922 wedding of Princess Mary at the abbey. In 1923, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon became the first royal bride to leave her bouquet on the grave of the Unknown Warrior, a practice continued by many royal brides since.\n\nRoyal weddings have included:\n\n\n=== Funerals ===\nMany royal funerals took place at the abbey between that of Edward the Confessor in 1066 and that of Prince Henry, the last royal buried in the church, in 1790. There were no royal funerals at the abbey from then until that of Queen Alexandra in 1925; the queen was buried in Windsor Castle. Other queen consorts, such as Mary of Teck in 1953 and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002, have also had funerals at the abbey before being buried elsewhere.\nOn 6 September 1997, the ceremonial funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales was held at the abbey. Before the funeral, the railings of the abbey were swamped with flowers and tributes. The event was more widely seen than any previous occasion in the abbey's history, with 2 billion television viewers worldwide. Diana was buried privately on a private island at Althorp, her family estate.\nOn 19 September 2022, the state funeral of Elizabeth II took place at the abbey before her burial at St George's Chapel, Windsor. It was the first funeral of a monarch at Westminster Abbey for more than 260 years.\n\n\n== People ==\n\n\n=== Dean and Chapter ===\n\nWestminster Abbey is a collegiate church governed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster as established by a royal charter from Elizabeth I dated 21 May 1560, which created it as the Collegiate Church of St Peter Westminster (a royal peculiar). In 2019, David Hoyle was appointed Dean of Westminster. The chapter consists of four canons and a senior administrative officer, known as the Receiver General. One of the canons is also rector of the adjoining St Margaret's Church, Westminster, and is often the chaplain of the Speaker of the House of Commons. In addition to the dean and canons, there are minor canons.\n\n\n=== King's almsmen ===\nSix King's (or Queen's) almsmen and women are supported by the abbey. They are appointed by royal warrant on the recommendation of the dean and the Home Secretary, attend Matins and Evensong on Sundays, and perform requested duties for a small stipend. On duty, they wear a distinctive red gown with a crowned rose badge on the left shoulder.\nThe almshouse was founded near the abbey by Henry VII in 1502, and the twelve almsmen and three almswomen were originally minor court officials who were retired due to age or disability. They were required to be over the age of 50, single, with a good reputation, literate, able to look after themselves, and with an income of under £4 per year. The building survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but was demolished for road-widening in 1779. From the late 18th to the late 20th century, almsmen were usually old soldiers and sailors; today, they are primarily retired abbey employees.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\n\nWestminster School is in the abbey. Instruction has taken place since the 14th century with the monks of the abbey; the school regards its founder as Elizabeth I, who dissolved the monastery for the last time and provided for the establishment of the school, the dean, canons, assistant clergy, and lay officers. The schoolboys were rambunctious; Westminster boys have defaced the Coronation Chair, disrupted services, and once interrupted the consecration of four bishops with a bare-knuckle fight in the cloisters. One schoolboy carved on the Coronation Chair that he had slept in it overnight, making him probably its longest inhabitant.

Charles Kingsley, a prominent socialist politician and abolitionist, engaged in a sustained and often confrontational campaign to influence the religious community regarding Darwin’s views on evolution. His attempts were multifaceted, involving direct appeals, parliamentary debates, and publications that highlighted Darwin’s scientific findings and his perceived threat to religious doctrine. Specifically, he utilized the following strategies:

1.  **Parliamentary Debate:** Kingsley relentlessly challenged religious leaders and theologians to consider the implications of Darwin's theory on religious belief. He frequently questioned their interpretations of scripture and sought to demonstrate how Darwin’s work contradicted core tenets of faith.

2.  **Public Appeals:** Kingsley utilized his extensive network of contacts – including prominent figures within the Church and among influential academics – to disseminate his arguments through speeches, articles, and letters. He aimed to awaken public consciousness about the issue and to build a coalition of opponents to Darwin.

3.  **Publication of ""The Protestant Threat"":** Kingsley's book, published in 1857, was a direct indictment of Darwin's theories as an ""unnatural"" and ""dangerous"" influence on the Christian faith.  He argued that Darwin’s research undermined the authority of the Bible and threatened the moral integrity of the Church.

Charles Kingsley attempted to influence the religious community regarding Darwin’s views by presenting evidence of Darwin's social and ethical implications, specifically his study of the British population and his findings on the social effects of industrial capitalism. He utilized the ‘Voyage of the Beagle’ as a case study to illustrate his observations. The significance of the Bishop of Oxford’s response is that it demonstrated a recognition of the complexity of the issue and a cautious approach towards Darwin’s ideas, allowing him to cautiously engage with the religious community.

**Reasoning:**

The text explicitly states Charles Kingsley’s attempt to influence the religious community and highlights his presentation of evidence on social effects, specifically the colonial population and the industrial impact.  It also implies a cautious approach to the matter, as demonstrated by the Bishop of Oxford's response.

It’s important to note that, while the text doesn’t detail the Bishop’s *specific* response, the overall context—the deliberate and evidence-based presentation of his work—suggests a deliberate effort to foster a dialogue about Darwin’s ideas in a way that considered the religious and social implications of his findings.

The Edinburgh University Theatre Company (EUTC) has a long and storied history, beginning in 1891, and is considered one of the oldest and most prominent theatrical companies in Scotland. Initially founded as a theatrical society, the EUTC moved to its current location at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre in 1925. Throughout its history, the EUTC has produced a wide range of plays, often exploring social and political themes. A significant and enduring contribution of the EUTC is its dedication to innovative and experimental theatre. The company is particularly renowned for its work with modernist playwrights such as William Lindsay Jackson, and for its contributions to the development of new dramatic forms. They've frequently experimented with theatrical techniques like collage, mime, and shadow play. They also have collaborated with many of the most influential theatre figures of the 20th century, including the impresario, the writer, and the director. The company’s work has spanned various genres, from realism to absurdist theatre, and has consistently pushed the boundaries of theatrical expression. The EUTC continues to be a vital part of Edinburgh’s cultural landscape and a significant force in the development of contemporary theatre.

What specific geographic features and discoveries did Darwin make during his voyage on HMS Beagle?,"['=== Survey voyage on HMS Beagle ===\n\nAfter leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a few days with student friends at Barmouth. He returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) naturalist for a self-funded supernumerary place on HMS Beagle with captain Robert FitzRoy, a position for a gentleman rather than ""a mere collector"". The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America. Robert Darwin objected to his son\'s planned two-year voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, Josiah Wedgwood II, to agree to (and fund) his son\'s participation. Darwin took care to remain in a private capacity to retain control over his collection, intending it for a major scientific institution.\nAfter delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations. At intervals during the voyage, his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas, was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected during a calm spell.\n\nOn their first stop ashore at St Jago in Cape Verde, Darwin found that a white band high in the volcanic rock cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of Charles Lyell\'s Principles of Geology, which set out uniformitarian concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,[II] and Darwin saw things Lyell\'s way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology. When they reached Brazil, Darwin was delighted by the tropical forest, but detested the sight of slavery there, and disputed this issue with FitzRoy.\nThe survey continued to the south in Patagonia. They stopped at Bahía Blanca, and in cliffs near Punta Alta Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct mammals beside modern seashells, indicating recent extinction with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He found bony plates like a giant version of the armour on local armadillos. From a jaw and tooth he identified the gigantic Megatherium, then from Cuvier\'s description thought the armour was from this animal. The finds were shipped to England, and scientists found the fossils of great interest. In Patagonia, Darwin came to wrongly believe the territory was devoid of reptiles.\nOn rides with gauchos into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, Darwin gained social, political and anthropological insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of rhea had separate but overlapping territories. Further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as raised beaches at a series of elevations. He read Lyell\'s second volume and accepted its view of ""centres of creation"" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell\'s ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.\nThree Fuegians on board, who had been seized during the first Beagle voyage then given Christian education in England, were returning with a missionary. Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at Tierra del Fuego he met ""miserable, degraded savages"", as different as wild from domesticated animals. He remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with a shared origin and potential for improvement towards civilisation. Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. A year on, the mission had been abandoned. The Fuegian they had named Jemmy Button lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.\n\nDarwin experienced an earthquake in Chile in 1835 and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including mussel-beds stranded above high tide. High in the Andes he saw seashells and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, oceanic islands sank, and coral reefs round them grew to form atolls.\nOn the geologically new Galápagos Islands, Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older ""centre of creation"", and found mockingbirds allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island.']","

What is the significance of the Historical links between Edinburgh and other universities?,"[""=== Historical links ===\nEdinburgh has several historical links to other universities, chiefly through its influential Medical School and its graduates, who established and developed institutions elsewhere in the world.\n\nColumbia University: had its Medical School founded by Samuel Bard, an Edinburgh medical graduate.\nDalhousie University: Edinburgh alumnus George Ramsay, the 22nd Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, wanted to establish a non-denominational college in Halifax open to all. The school was modelled after the University of Edinburgh, which students could attend regardless of religion or nationality.\nDartmouth College: had its School of Medicine founded by Nathan Smith, an alumnus of Edinburgh Medical School.\nHarvard University: had its Medical School founded by three surgeons, one of whom was Benjamin Waterhouse, an alumnus of Edinburgh Medical School.\nMcGill University: had its Faculty of Medicine founded by four physicians, which included Edinburgh alumni Andrew Fernando Holmes and John Stephenson.\nUniversity of Pennsylvania: had its School of Medicine founded by Edinburgh graduate John Morgan, who modelled it after Edinburgh Medical School.\nPrinceton University: had its academic syllabus and structure reformed along the lines of the University of Edinburgh and other Scottish universities by its sixth president John Witherspoon, an Edinburgh theology graduate.\nUniversity of Sydney: founded in 1850 by Sir Charles Nicholson, a graduate of Edinburgh Medical School.\nCollege of William & Mary: the second-oldest college in the US was founded in 1693 by Edinburgh graduate James Blair, who served as the college's founding president for fifty years.\nYale University: had its School of Medicine co-founded by Nathan Smith, an alumnus of Edinburgh Medical School.\n\n\n== Campuses and buildings ==\n\nThe university has five main sites in Edinburgh:\n\nCentral Area\nKing's Buildings\nBioQuarter\nEaster Bush\nWestern General\nThe university is responsible for several significant historic and modern buildings across the city, including St Cecilia's Hall, Scotland's oldest purpose-built concert hall and the second oldest in use in the British Isles; Teviot Row House, the oldest purpose-built students' union building in the world; and the restored 17th-century Mylne's Court student residence at the head of the Royal Mile.\n\n\n=== Central Area ===\n\nThe Central Area is spread around numerous squares and streets in Edinburgh's Southside, with some buildings in Old Town. It is the university's oldest area, occupied primarily by the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences and the School of Informatics. The highest concentration of university buildings is around George Square, which includes 40 George Square (formerly David Hume Tower), Appleton Tower, Main Library, and Gordon Aikman Lecture Theatre, the area's largest lecture hall. Around nearby Bristo Square lie the Dugald Stewart Building, Informatics Forum, McEwan Hall, Potterrow Student Centre, Teviot Row House, and old Medical School, which still houses pre-clinical medical courses and biomedical sciences. The Pleasance, one of Edinburgh University Students' Association's main buildings, is located nearby, as is Edinburgh College of Art in Lauriston. North of George Square lies the university's Old College housing Edinburgh Law School, New College on The Mound housing the School of Divinity, and St Cecilia's Hall. Some of these buildings are used to host events during the Edinburgh International Festival and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe every summer.\n\n\n==== Pollock Halls ====\n\nPollock Halls, adjoining Holyrood Park to the east, is the university's largest residence hall for undergraduate students in their first year. The complex houses over 2,000 students during term time and consists of ten named buildings with communal green spaces between them. The two original buildings, St Leonard's Hall and Salisbury Green, were built in the 19th century, while the majority of Pollock Halls dates from the 1960s and early 2000s. Two of the older houses in Pollock Halls were demolished in 2002, and a new building, Chancellor's Court, was built in their place and opened in 2003. Self-catered flats elsewhere account for the majority of university-provided accommodation. The area also includes the John McIntyre Conference Centre opened in 2009, which is the university's premier conference space.""]","
The significance of the Historical links between Edinburgh and other universities is that Edinburgh's influence is heavily rooted in its historical connections to other universities, especially those of the Medical School. Specifically, its link to Columbia University, Dalhousie University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, McGill University, University of Pennsylvania, and Princeton University, which established and developed institutions elsewhere in the world.  These connections were established through graduates who established and developed universities and colleges, demonstrating Edinburgh's long-standing tradition of educational innovation and collaboration.
",ai (google/gemma-3-1b-it),ai (google/gemma-3-1b-it),./data/4_gemma_wiki_pages.csv,"

The historical links between Edinburgh and other universities are complex and deeply intertwined.  Edinburgh's history has a long and continuous connection to many prominent universities, particularly in Scotland and Europe.  The University of Edinburgh has been inextricably linked to institutions like New College, Edinburgh Law School, the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College, and the Moray House Institute of Education.  The relationship has expanded significantly since the 19th century, with Edinburgh being a key part of the British Empire and a center of scientific and academic innovation.  The connections to institutions like the University of Amsterdam and the University of Copenhagen reflect Edinburgh's broader engagement with international scholarship and collaboration. The legacy of these connections continues to shape the university's reputation and research profile today.

Around nearby Bristo Square lie the Dugald Stewart Building, Informatics Forum, McEwan Hall, Potterrow Student Centre, Teviot Row House, and old Medical School, which still houses pre-clinical medical courses and biomedical sciences. The Pleasance, one of Edinburgh University Students' Association's main buildings, is located nearby, as is Edinburgh College of Art in Lauriston.

The significance of the Historical links between Edinburgh and other universities is that Edinburgh's influence is heavily rooted in its historical connections to other universities, especially those of the Medical School. Specifically, its link to Columbia University, Dalhousie University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, McGill University, University of Pennsylvania, and Princeton University, which established and developed institutions elsewhere in the world.  These connections were established through graduates who established and developed universities and colleges, demonstrating Edinburgh's long-standing tradition of educational innovation and collaboration.

In 1919, the university bought the land of West Mains Farm in the south of the city for the development of a new satellite campus specialising in the sciences. On 6 July 1920, King George V laid the foundation of the first new building (now called the Joseph Black Building), housing the Department of Chemistry. The campus was named King's Buildings in honour of George V.\n\nNew College on The Mound was originally opened in 1846 as a Free Church of Scotland college, later of the United Free Church of Scotland. Since the 1930s it has been the home of the School of Divinity. Prior to the 1929 reunion of the Church of Scotland, candidates for the ministry in the United Free Church studied at New College, whilst candidates for the Church of Scotland studied in the university's Faculty of Divinity. In 1935 the two institutions merged, with all operations moved to the New College site in Old Town.

While it was originally intended for students and doctors in the Polish Armed Forces in the West, civilians were also allowed to take the courses, which were taught in Polish and awarded Polish medical degrees. When the school was closed in 1949, 336 students had matriculated, of which 227 students graduated with the equivalent of an MBChB and a total of 19 doctors obtained a doctorate or MD.

Which of the following best describes the relationship between the abbey and the burials within it?,"['== Burials and memorials ==\n\nOver 3,300 people are buried or commemorated in the abbey. For much of its history, most of the people buried there (other than monarchs) were people with a connection to the church – either ordinary locals or the monks of the abbey, who were generally buried without surviving markers. Since the 18th century, it has been an honour for any British person to be buried or commemorated in the abbey – a practice boosted by the lavish funeral and monument of Isaac Newton, who died in 1727. By 1900, so many prominent figures were buried in the abbey that the writer William Morris called it a ""National Valhalla"".\nPoliticians buried in the abbey include Pitt the Elder, Charles James Fox, Pitt the Younger, William Wilberforce, William Gladstone, and Clement Attlee. A cluster of scientists surrounds the tomb of Isaac Newton, including Charles Darwin and Stephen Hawking. Actors include David Garrick, Henry Irving, and Laurence Olivier. Musicians tend to be buried in the north aisle of the nave, and include Henry Purcell and Ralph Vaughan Williams. George Frideric Handel is buried in Poets\' Corner.\n\nAn estimated 18 English, Scottish and British monarchs are buried in the abbey, including Edward the Confessor, Henry III, Edward I, Edward III, Richard II, Henry V, Edward V, Henry VII, Edward VI, Mary I, Mary Queen of Scots, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles II, Mary II, William III, Queen Anne, and George II. Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots were the last monarchs to be buried with full tomb effigies; monarchs buried after them are commemorated in the abbey with simple inscriptions. George II was the last monarch to be buried in the abbey, in 1760, and George III\'s brother, Henry Frederick, was the last member of the royal family to be buried in the abbey, in 1790. Most monarchs after George II have been buried in St George\'s Chapel, Windsor Castle, or at the Frogmore Royal Burial Ground, east of Windsor Castle.\n\n\n=== Poets\' Corner ===\n\nThe south transept of the church is known as Poets\' Corner because of its high number of burials of, and memorials to, poets and writers. The first was Geoffrey Chaucer (buried around 1400), who was employed as Clerk of the King\'s Works and had apartments in the abbey. A second poet, Edmund Spenser (who was local to the abbey), was buried nearby in 1599. The idea of a Poets\' Corner did not crystallise until the 18th century, when memorials were established to writers buried elsewhere, such as William Shakespeare and John Milton. Since then, writers buried in Poets\' Corner have included John Dryden, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Charles Dickens, and Rudyard Kipling. Not all writers buried in the abbey are in the south transept; Ben Jonson is buried standing upright in the north aisle of the nave, and Aphra Behn in the cloisters.\n\n\n=== The Unknown Warrior ===\n\nOn the floor, just inside the Great West Door in the centre of the nave, is the grave of the Unknown Warrior: an unidentified soldier killed on a European battlefield during the First World War. Although many countries have a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (or Warrior), the one in Westminster Abbey was the first; it came about as a response to the unprecedented death toll of the war. The idea came from army chaplain David Railton, who suggested it in 1920. The funeral was held on 11 November 1920, the second anniversary of the end of the war. The Unknown Warrior lay in state for a week afterwards, and an estimated 1.25 million people viewed his gravesite in that time. This grave is the only floor stone in the abbey on which it is forbidden to walk, and every visit by a foreign head of state begins with a visit to it.']","

How did the organizational structure and lack of land endowments contribute to Edinburgh University's role in the Scottish Enlightenment during the 18th century?,"['== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nIn 1557, Bishop Robert Reid of St Magnus Cathedral on Orkney made a will containing an endowment of 8,000 merks to build a college in Edinburgh. Unusually for his time, Reid\'s vision included the teaching of rhetoric and poetry, alongside more traditional subjects such as philosophy. However, the bequest was delayed by more than 25 years due to the religious revolution that led to the Reformation Parliament of 1560. The plans were revived in the late 1570s through efforts by the Edinburgh Town Council, first minister of Edinburgh James Lawson, and Lord Provost William Little. When Reid\'s descendants were unwilling to pay out the sum, the town council petitioned King James VI and his Privy Council. The King brokered a monetary compromise and granted a royal charter on 14 April 1582, empowering the town council to create a college of higher education. A college established by secular authorities was unprecedented in newly Presbyterian Scotland, as all previous Scottish universities had been founded through papal bulls.\n\nNamed Tounis College (Town\'s College), the university opened its doors to students on 14 October 1583, with an attendance of 80–90. At the time, the college mainly covered liberal arts and divinity. Instruction began under the charge of a graduate from the University of St Andrews, theologian Robert Rollock, who first served as Regent, and from 1586 as principal of the college. Initially Rollock was the sole instructor for first-year students, and he was expected to tutor the 1583 intake for all four years of their degree in every subject. The first cohort finished their studies in 1587, and 47 students graduated (or \'laureated\') with an M.A. degree. When King James VI visited Scotland in 1617, he held a disputation with the college\'s professors, after which he decreed that it should henceforth be called the ""Colledge [sic] of King James"". The university was known as both Tounis College and King James\' College until it gradually assumed the name of the University of Edinburgh during the 17th century.\nAfter the deposition of King James II and VII during the Glorious Revolution in 1688, the Parliament of Scotland passed legislation designed to root out Jacobite sympathisers amongst university staff. In Edinburgh, this led to the dismissal of Principal Alexander Monro and several professors and regents after a government visitation in 1690. The university was subsequently led by Principal Gilbert Rule, one of the inquisitors on the visitation committee.\n\n\n=== 18th and 19th century ===\n\nThe late 17th and early 18th centuries were marked by a power struggle between the university and town council, which had ultimate authority over staff appointments, curricula, and examinations. After a series of challenges by the university, the conflict culminated in the council seizing the college records in 1704. Relations were only gradually repaired over the next 150 years and suffered repeated setbacks.\nIn 1708 the Principal William Carsatres restructured the University, abolishing the regenting system and establishing a Dutch style system of Professors. The newly created Chairs, such as that of Greek and Humanity, were offered to the existing Regents. The university expanded by founding a Faculty of Law in 1707, a Faculty of Arts in 1708, and a Faculty of Medicine in 1726. In 1762, Reverend Hugh Blair was appointed by King George III as the first Regius Professor of Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres. This formalised literature as a subject and marks the foundation of the English Literature department, making Edinburgh the oldest centre of literary education in Britain.\nDuring the 18th century, the university was at the centre of the Scottish Enlightenment. The ideas of the Age of Enlightenment fell on especially fertile ground in Edinburgh because of the university\'s democratic and secular origin; its organization as a single entity instead of loosely connected colleges, which encouraged academic exchange; its adoption of the more flexible Dutch model of professorship, rather than having student cohorts taught by a single regent; and the lack of land endowments as its source of income, which meant its faculty operated in a more competitive environment. Between 1750 and 1800, this system produced and attracted key Enlightenment figures such as chemist Joseph Black, economist Adam Smith, historian William Robertson, philosophers David Hume and Dugald Stewart, physician William Cullen, and early sociologist Adam Ferguson, many of which taught concurrently. By the time the Royal Society of Edinburgh was founded in 1783, the university was regarded as one of the world\'s preeminent scientific institutions, and Voltaire called Edinburgh a ""hotbed of genius"" as a result.']","The organizational structure and lack of land endowments played significant roles in contributing to the University of Edinburgh's prominence during the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century.

1. **Organizational Structure**: 
   - The university was organized as a single entity rather than being composed of loosely connected colleges. This centralized organization facilitated academic exchange and collaboration among faculty members, which was crucial for fostering innovative ideas.
   - It adopted a Dutch model of professorship, replacing the regenting system with a more flexible structure where professors specialized in different subjects. This allowed students to learn from multiple experts rather than being taught by a single instructor throughout their studies, promoting a broader and more diverse intellectual environment.

2. **Lack of Land Endowments**:
   - Unlike many other universities that relied on land endowments for income, Edinburgh University operated without such financial security. This lack of guaranteed funding created a competitive atmosphere among faculty members, who were motivated to excel in their fields to attract students and secure their positions.
   - The need to compete for resources likely encouraged innovation and excellence, as professors sought to enhance the university's reputation through groundbreaking research and teaching.

Together, these factors created an environment conducive to intellectual growth and exchange. This setting attracted and nurtured key figures of the Enlightenment, such as Joseph Black, Adam Smith, David Hume, and others, who contributed significantly to various fields of knowledge.

*   **Focus on Education:** Initially, the emphasis was on education, particularly medicine and theology, attracting skilled individuals and fostering a culture of intellectual pursuit.
