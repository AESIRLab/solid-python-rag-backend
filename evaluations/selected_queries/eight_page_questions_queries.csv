83,"How many Nobel Prizes are awarded to alumni, faculty members, and researchers at the University of Edinburgh, and what are the specific roles/ affiliations of the laureates mentioned in the text?","['=== Nobel and Nobel equivalent prizes ===\n\nAs of October 2024, 20 Nobel Prize laureates, with 20 awards, have been affiliated with the university as alumni, faculty members or researchers (three additional laureates acted as administrative staff), including one of the fathers of quantum mechanics Max Born, theoretical physicist Peter Higgs, Cognitive scientist Geoffrey E. Hinton (also a Turing Award winner), chemist Sir Fraser Stoddart, immunologist Peter C. Doherty, economist Sir James Mirrlees, discoverer of Characteristic X-ray (Charles Glover Barkla) and the mechanism of ATP synthesis (Peter D. Mitchell), and pioneer in cryo-electron microscopy (Richard Henderson) and in-vitro fertilisation (Sir Robert Edwards).  Turing Award winners Robin Milner Leslie Valiant, and mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah, Fields Medalist and Abel Prize laureate, are associated with the university.\nIn the following table, the number following a person\'s name is the year they received the Nobel prize. In particular, a number with an asterisk (*) means the person received the award while they were working at the university (including emeritus staff). A name underlined implies that this person has been listed previously (i.e., multiple affiliations).\n\n\n=== Heads of state and government ===\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe University of Edinburgh has featured prominently in a number of works of popular culture.\n\nThe events of the Burke and Hare murders, involving Edinburgh lecturer Robert Knox and the anatomical department, have made a wide range of appearances in popular culture. They became the basis for Robert Louis Stevenson\'s short story The Body Snatcher (1884), and most recently in 2010 for Burke & Hare, a black comedy film starring Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis. Scenes were filmed at the old School of Anatomy.\nMany of Arthur Conan Doyle\'s works drew inspiration from his mentors at the university. Joseph Bell, a lecturer and surgeon famous for drawing conclusions from minute observations, became the archetype for Conan Doyle\'s fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. William Rutherford, Conan Doyle\'s physiology professor provided the template for Professor Challenger, the protagonist of his science fiction work The Lost World (1912). Edinburgh is also Challenger\'s alma mater in the books.\nDr. Fu Manchu, a fictional supervillain created by Sax Rohmer in 1912, stated that ""I am a doctor of philosophy from Edinburgh, a doctor of law from Christ\'s College, a doctor of medicine from Harvard. My friends, out of courtesy, call me \'Doctor\'."" In 2010, Fu Manchu\'s connections with the University where he supposedly obtained a doctorate were investigated in a mockumentary by Miles Jupp (also an Edinburgh alumnus) for BBC Radio 4.\nIn the movie Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959), an adaptation of Jules Verne\'s novel of the same name, the protagonist Sir Oliver Lindenbrook is a Professor of Geology at the university. An early scene where Lindenbrook addresses the students is filmed at the central quadrangle of Old College.\nThe historical film Chariots of Fire (1981) is based on the story of Olympic runner and Edinburgh graduate Eric Liddell, and includes scenes filmed outside of Assembly Hall, New College. Liddell is played by Ian Charleson, who is also an Edinburgh alumnus.\nIn the novel The Last King of Scotland (1998) by Giles Foden, the fictional protagonist Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is a medical doctor recently graduated from Edinburgh. The 2006 film of the same name stars James McAvoy in the role of Dr. Garrigan with the same background.\nIn the American television show NCIS (2003–present), the chief medical examiner, Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard studied medicine at Edinburgh. Ari Haswari, the show\'s main antagonist for the first two seasons, also studied medicine at Edinburgh.\nIn the novel One Day (2009), the lead characters Dexter and Emma both graduated from Edinburgh. A feature film based on the book, also titled One Day and starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess was released in August 2011, with some scenes filmed at the university. A Netflix adaptation of the movie started production in 2021, with filming occurring in the grounds of Old College in 2022.\nThe BBC legal drama Garrow\'s Law (2009–2011) was largely filmed in Edinburgh, despite being set in London. Old College and the Playfair Library are prominently featured.\nThe thriller television series Clique (2017–2019) produced by BBC Three focuses on two students at the university. The series was shot largely on location in Edinburgh, including The Meadows, Old College, and Potterrow.\nFast & Furious 9 (2021), partly set in Edinburgh, featured scenes in and around Old College filmed in September 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==']","20 Nobel Prize laureates have been affiliated with the university as alumni, faculty members, or researchers (three additional laureates acted as administrative staff).

52,"How many royal weddings have taken place at the abbey, and what is the most significant change to the wedding practices that occurred?","[""=== Weddings ===\nAt least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey. Royal weddings at the abbey were relatively rare before the 20th century, with royals often married in a Chapel Royal or at Windsor Castle; this changed with the 1922 wedding of Princess Mary at the abbey. In 1923, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon became the first royal bride to leave her bouquet on the grave of the Unknown Warrior, a practice continued by many royal brides since.\n\nRoyal weddings have included:\n\n\n=== Funerals ===\nMany royal funerals took place at the abbey between that of Edward the Confessor in 1066 and that of Prince Henry, the last royal buried in the church, in 1790. There were no royal funerals at the abbey from then until that of Queen Alexandra in 1925; the queen was buried in Windsor Castle. Other queen consorts, such as Mary of Teck in 1953 and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002, have also had funerals at the abbey before being buried elsewhere.\nOn 6 September 1997, the ceremonial funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales was held at the abbey. Before the funeral, the railings of the abbey were swamped with flowers and tributes. The event was more widely seen than any previous occasion in the abbey's history, with 2 billion television viewers worldwide. Diana was buried privately on a private island at Althorp, her family estate.\nOn 19 September 2022, the state funeral of Elizabeth II took place at the abbey before her burial at St George's Chapel, Windsor. It was the first funeral of a monarch at Westminster Abbey for more than 260 years.\n\n\n== People ==\n\n\n=== Dean and Chapter ===\n\nWestminster Abbey is a collegiate church governed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster as established by a royal charter from Elizabeth I dated 21 May 1560, which created it as the Collegiate Church of St Peter Westminster (a royal peculiar). In 2019, David Hoyle was appointed Dean of Westminster. The chapter consists of four canons and a senior administrative officer, known as the Receiver General. One of the canons is also rector of the adjoining St Margaret's Church, Westminster, and is often the chaplain of the Speaker of the House of Commons. In addition to the dean and canons, there are minor canons.\n\n\n=== King's almsmen ===\nSix King's (or Queen's) almsmen and women are supported by the abbey. They are appointed by royal warrant on the recommendation of the dean and the Home Secretary, attend Matins and Evensong on Sundays, and perform requested duties for a small stipend. On duty, they wear a distinctive red gown with a crowned rose badge on the left shoulder.\nThe almshouse was founded near the abbey by Henry VII in 1502, and the twelve almsmen and three almswomen were originally minor court officials who were retired due to age or disability. They were required to be over the age of 50, single, with a good reputation, literate, able to look after themselves, and with an income of under £4 per year. The building survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but was demolished for road-widening in 1779. From the late 18th to the late 20th century, almsmen were usually old soldiers and sailors; today, they are primarily retired abbey employees.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\n\nWestminster School is in the abbey. Instruction has taken place since the 14th century with the monks of the abbey; the school regards its founder as Elizabeth I, who dissolved the monastery for the last time and provided for the establishment of the school, the dean, canons, assistant clergy, and lay officers. The schoolboys were rambunctious; Westminster boys have defaced the Coronation Chair, disrupted services, and once interrupted the consecration of four bishops with a bare-knuckle fight in the cloisters. One schoolboy carved on the Coronation Chair that he had slept in it overnight, making him probably its longest inhabitant. Westminster School became independent of the abbey Dean and Chapter in 1868, although the institutions remain closely connected. Westminster Abbey Choir School, also on the abbey grounds, educates the choirboys who sing for abbey services.""]","16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey. The most significant change to the wedding practices is the change from the traditional Chapel Royal or Windsor Castle weddings to the more private, intimate ceremony of the 1922 wedding of Princess Mary and the grave of the Unknown Warrior.

61,What are the key features and objectives of the Richard Verney Health Centre?,"[""=== 21st century ===\nIn the 1990s it became apparent that the old Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place were no longer adequate for a modern teaching hospital. Donald Dewar, the Scottish Secretary at the time, authorized a joint project between private finance, local authorities, and the university to create a modern hospital and medical campus in the Little France area of Edinburgh. The new campus was named the BioQuarter. The Chancellor's Building was opened on 12 August 2002 by Prince Philip, housing the new Edinburgh Medical School alongside the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In 2007, the campus saw the addition of the Euan MacDonald Centre as a research centre for motor neuron diseases, which was part-funded by Scottish entrepreneur Euan MacDonald and his father Donald. In August 2010, author J. K. Rowling provided £10 million in funding to create the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, which was officially opened in October 2013. The Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM) is a stem cell research centre dedicated to the development of regenerative treatments, which was opened in 2012. CRM is also home to applied scientists working with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) and Roslin Cells.\n\nIn December 2002, the Edinburgh Cowgate fire destroyed a number of university buildings, including some 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) of the School of Informatics at 80 South Bridge. This was replaced with the Informatics Forum on Bristo Square, completed in July 2008. Also in 2002, the Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre (ECRC) was opened on the Western General Hospital site. In 2007, the MRC Human Genetics Unit formed a partnership with the Centre for Genomic & Experimental Medicine and the ECRC to create the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine (renamed the Institute of Genetics and Cancer in 2021) on the same site.\nIn April 2008, the Roslin Institute – an animal sciences research centre known for cloning Dolly the sheep – became part of the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies. In 2011, the school moved into a new £60 million building on the Easter Bush campus, which now houses research and teaching facilities, and a hospital for small and farm animals.\n\nEdinburgh College of Art, founded in 1760, formally merged with the university's School of Arts, Culture and Environment on 1 August 2011. In 2014, the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute (ZJE) was founded as an international joint institute offering degrees in biomedical sciences, taught in English. The campus, located in Haining, Zhejiang Province, China, was established on 15 March 2016.\nThe university began hosting a Wikimedian in Residence in 2016. The residency was made into a full-time position in 2019, with the Wikimedian involved in teaching and learning activities within the scope of the University of Edinburgh WikiProject.\nIn 2018, the University of Edinburgh was a signatory to the £1.3 billion Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal, in partnership with the UK and Scottish governments, six local authorities and all universities and colleges in the region. The university committed to delivering a range of economic benefits to the region through the Data-Driven Innovation initiative. In conjunction with Heriot-Watt University, the deal created five innovation hubs: the Bayes Centre, Edinburgh Futures Institute, Usher Institute, Easter Bush, and one further hub based at Heriot-Watt, the National Robotarium. The deal also included creation of the Edinburgh International Data Facility, which performs high-speed data processing in a secure environment.\nIn September 2020, the university completed work on the Richard Verney Health Centre at its central area campus on Bristo Square. The facility houses a health centre and pharmacy, and the university's disability and counselling services. The university's largest expansion in the 2020s was the conversion of some of the historic Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place, which had been vacated in 2003 and partially developed into the Quartermile. The £120 million project created a home for the Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI), an interdisciplinary hub linking arts, humanities, and social sciences with other disciplines in the research and teaching of complex, multi-stakeholder societal challenges. The EFI officially opened its doors to the public on 4 June 2024.""]","

The school was modelled after the University of Edinburgh, which students could attend regardless of religion or nationality.\nDartmouth College: had its School of Medicine founded by Nathan Smith, an alumnus of Edinburgh Medical School.\nHarvard University: had its Medical School founded by three surgeons, one of whom was Benjamin Waterhouse, an alumnus of Edinburgh Medical School.\nMcGill University: had its Faculty of Medicine founded by four physicians, which included Edinburgh alumni Andrew Fernando Holmes and John Stephenson.\nUniversity of Pennsylvania: had its School of Medicine founded by Edinburgh graduate John Morgan, who modelled it after Edinburgh Medical School.\nPrinceton University: had its academic syllabus and structure reformed along the lines of the University of Edinburgh and other Scottish universities by its sixth president John Witherspoon, an Edinburgh theology graduate.\nUniversity of Sydney: founded in 1850 by Sir Charles Nicholson, a graduate of Edinburgh Medical School.\nCollege of William & Mary: the second-oldest college in the US was founded in 1693 by Edinburgh graduate James Blair, who served as the college's founding president for fifty years.\nYale University: had its School of Medicine co-founded by Nathan Smith, an alumnus of Edinburgh Medical School.\n\n\n== Campuses and buildings ==\n\nThe university has five main sites in Edinburgh:\n\nCentral Area\nKing's Buildings\nBioQuarter\nEaster Bush\nWestern General\nThe university is responsible for several significant historic and modern buildings across the city, including St Cecilia's Hall, Scotland's oldest purpose-built concert hall and the second oldest in use in the British Isles; Teviot Row House, the oldest purpose-built students' union building in the world; and the restored 17th-century Mylne's Court student residence at the head of the Royal Mile.\n\n\n=== Central Area ===\n\nThe Central Area is spread around numerous squares and streets in Edinburgh's Southside, with some buildings in Old Town. It is the university's oldest area, occupied primarily by the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences and the School of Informatics. The highest concentration of university buildings is around George Square, which includes 40 George Square (formerly David Hume Tower), Appleton Tower, Main Library, and Gordon Aikman Lecture Theatre, the area's largest lecture hall. Around nearby Bristo Square lie the Dugald Stewart Building, Informatics Forum, McEwan Hall, Potterrow Student Centre, Teviot Row House, and old Medical School, which still houses pre-clinical medical courses and biomedical sciences. The Pleasance, one of Edinburgh University Students' Association's main buildings, is located nearby, as is Edinburgh College of Art in Lauriston. North of George Square lies the university's Old College housing Edinburgh Law School, New College on The Mound housing the School of Divinity, and St Cecilia's Hall. Some of these buildings are used to host events during the Edinburgh International Festival and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe every summer.\n\n\n==== Pollock Halls ====\n\nPollock Halls, adjoining Holyrood Park to the east, is the university's largest residence hall for undergraduate students in their first year.

Two of the older houses in Pollock Halls were demolished in 2002, and a new building, Chancellor's Court, was built in their place and opened in 2003. Self-catered flats elsewhere account for the majority of university-provided accommodation. The area also includes the John McIntyre Conference Centre opened in 2009, which is the university's premier conference space.""]","
If someone were studying at McGill University, they might expect to find some significant differences in the structure from the traditional model, particularly in its emphasis on academic curriculum. McGill’s structure heavily incorporates the principles of a more flexible, project-based approach to learning, similar to the model used by many of Edinburgh's historical institutions. McGill prioritizes student-centered learning, with more course-based, applied learning over the more formalized, didactic approach often found in traditional university settings. They might also find a more decentralized structure, where instruction is delivered by specialists rather than a generalized approach to delivery.

18,"What is the primary focus of Darwin's research, as evidenced by the text?","['=== Geology books, barnacles, evolutionary research ===\n\nDarwin now had the framework of his theory of natural selection ""by which to work"", as his ""prime hobby"". His research included extensive experimental selective breeding of plants and animals, finding evidence that species were not fixed and investigating many detailed ideas to refine and substantiate his theory. For fifteen years this work was in the background to his main occupation of writing on geology and publishing expert reports on the Beagle collections, in particular, the barnacles. \nThe impetus of Darwin\'s barnacle research came from a collection of a barnacle colony from Chile in 1835, which he dubbed Mr. Arthrobalanus. His confusion over the relationship of this species (Cryptophialus minutus) to other barnacles caused him to fixate on the systematics of the taxa. He wrote his first examination of the species in 1846 but did not formally describe it until 1854.\nFitzRoy\'s long-delayed Narrative was published in May 1839. Darwin\'s Journal and Remarks got good reviews as the third volume, and on 15 August it was published on its own. Early in 1842, Darwin wrote about his ideas to Charles Lyell, who noted that his ally ""denies seeing a beginning to each crop of species"".\nDarwin\'s book The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs on his theory of atoll formation was published in May 1842 after more than three years of work, and he then wrote his first ""pencil sketch"" of his theory of natural selection. To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural Down House in Kent in September. On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing with melodramatic humour ""it is like confessing a murder"". Hooker replied, ""There may, in my opinion, have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species. I shall be delighted to hear how you think that this change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject.""\n\nBy July, Darwin had expanded his ""sketch"" into a 230-page ""Essay"", to be expanded with his research results if he died prematurely. In November, the anonymously published sensational best-seller Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation brought wide interest in transmutation. Darwin scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but carefully reviewed his own arguments. Controversy erupted, and it continued to sell well despite contemptuous dismissal by scientists.\nDarwin completed his third geological book in 1846. He now renewed a fascination and expertise in marine invertebrates, dating back to his student days with Grant, by dissecting and classifying the barnacles he had collected on the voyage, enjoying observing beautiful structures and thinking about comparisons with allied structures. In 1847, Hooker read the ""Essay"" and sent notes that provided Darwin with the calm critical feedback that he needed, but would not commit himself and questioned Darwin\'s opposition to continuing acts of creation.\nIn an attempt to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went in 1849 to Dr. James Gully\'s Malvern spa and was surprised to find some benefit from hydrotherapy. Then, in 1851, his treasured daughter Annie fell ill, reawakening his fears that his illness might be hereditary. She died the same year after a long series of crises.\nIn eight years of work on barnacles, Darwin\'s theory helped him to find ""homologies"" showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and in some genera he found minute males parasitic on hermaphrodites, showing an intermediate stage in evolution of distinct sexes. In 1853, it earned him the Royal Society\'s Royal Medal, and it made his reputation as a biologist. Upon the conclusion of his research, Darwin declared ""I hate a barnacle as no man ever did before."" In 1854, he became a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, gaining postal access to its library. He began a major reassessment of his theory of species, and in November realised that divergence in the character of descendants could be explained by them becoming adapted to ""diversified places in the economy of nature"".\n\n\n=== Publication of the theory of natural selection ===\n\nBy the start of 1856, Darwin was investigating whether eggs and seeds could survive travel across seawater to spread species across oceans. Hooker increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend Thomas Henry Huxley was still firmly against the transmutation of species. Lyell was intrigued by Darwin\'s speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by Alfred Russel Wallace, ""On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species"", he saw similarities with Darwin\'s thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence.']","
Darwin's primary focus was his research on marine invertebrates, particularly barnacles. He meticulously studied the systematics, behavior, and structure of these creatures, aiming to demonstrate the evolutionary process through his experiments and observations.

9,"According to Darwin's observations, what was the primary reason for his continued focus on the coastal areas of South America?","['=== Survey voyage on HMS Beagle ===\n\nAfter leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a few days with student friends at Barmouth. He returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) naturalist for a self-funded supernumerary place on HMS Beagle with captain Robert FitzRoy, a position for a gentleman rather than ""a mere collector"". The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America. Robert Darwin objected to his son\'s planned two-year voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, Josiah Wedgwood II, to agree to (and fund) his son\'s participation. Darwin took care to remain in a private capacity to retain control over his collection, intending it for a major scientific institution.\nAfter delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations. At intervals during the voyage, his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas, was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected during a calm spell.\n\nOn their first stop ashore at St Jago in Cape Verde, Darwin found that a white band high in the volcanic rock cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of Charles Lyell\'s Principles of Geology, which set out uniformitarian concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,[II] and Darwin saw things Lyell\'s way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology. When they reached Brazil, Darwin was delighted by the tropical forest, but detested the sight of slavery there, and disputed this issue with FitzRoy.\nThe survey continued to the south in Patagonia. They stopped at Bahía Blanca, and in cliffs near Punta Alta Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct mammals beside modern seashells, indicating recent extinction with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He found bony plates like a giant version of the armour on local armadillos. From a jaw and tooth he identified the gigantic Megatherium, then from Cuvier\'s description thought the armour was from this animal. The finds were shipped to England, and scientists found the fossils of great interest. In Patagonia, Darwin came to wrongly believe the territory was devoid of reptiles.\nOn rides with gauchos into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, Darwin gained social, political and anthropological insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of rhea had separate but overlapping territories. Further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as raised beaches at a series of elevations. He read Lyell\'s second volume and accepted its view of ""centres of creation"" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell\'s ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.\nThree Fuegians on board, who had been seized during the first Beagle voyage then given Christian education in England, were returning with a missionary. Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at Tierra del Fuego he met ""miserable, degraded savages"", as different as wild from domesticated animals. He remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with a shared origin and potential for improvement towards civilisation. Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. A year on, the mission had been abandoned. The Fuegian they had named Jemmy Button lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.\n\nDarwin experienced an earthquake in Chile in 1835 and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including mussel-beds stranded above high tide. High in the Andes he saw seashells and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, oceanic islands sank, and coral reefs round them grew to form atolls.\nOn the geologically new Galápagos Islands, Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older ""centre of creation"", and found mockingbirds allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island.']","
The primary reason for Darwin's continued focus on the coastal areas of South America was to explore the marine invertebrates and to collect specimens for a major scientific institution.

127,"What academic disciplines did Sedgwick study at Trinity College, Cambridge, and what notable achievement did he earn upon obtaining his BA?","['== Life and career ==\nSedgwick was born in Dent, Yorkshire, the third child of an Anglican vicar. He was educated at Sedbergh School and Trinity College, Cambridge.\nHe studied mathematics and theology, and obtained his BA (5th Wrangler) from the University of Cambridge in 1808 and his MA in 1811. On 20 July 1817 he was ordained a deacon, then a year later he was ordained as a priest. His academic mentors at Cambridge were Thomas Jones and John Dawson. He became a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge and Woodwardian Professor of Geology at Cambridge from 1818, holding the chair until his death in 1873. His biography in the Cambridge Alumni database says that upon his acceptance of the position, Sedgwick had no working knowledge of geology. An 1851 portrait of Sedgwick by William Boxall hangs in Trinity\'s collection.\nSedgwick studied the geology of the British Isles and Europe. He founded the system for the classification of Cambrian rocks and with Roderick Murchison worked out the order of the Carboniferous and underlying Devonian strata. These studies were mostly carried out in the 1830s. The investigations into the Devonian meant that Sedgwick was involved with Murchison in a vigorous debate with Henry De la Beche, in what became known as the great Devonian controversy.\nHe also employed John William Salter for a short time in arranging the fossils in the Woodwardian Museum at Cambridge, and whom accompanied the professor on several geological expeditions (1842–1845) into Wales. John Ruthven, with whom Sedgwick has a room at Kendal museum co-named after him, also frequently accompanied Sedgwick in Wales and beyond.\nSedgwick investigated the phenomena of metamorphism and concretion, and was the first to distinguish clearly between stratification, jointing, and slaty cleavage. He was elected to Fellow of the Royal Society on 1 February 1821. In 1844, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was president of the Geological Society of London.\n\n\n== Geological views and evolution ==\n\nThe Church of England, by no means a fundamentalist or evangelical church, encloses a wide range of beliefs. During Sedgwick\'s life there developed something of a chasm between the conservative high church believers and the liberal wing. After simmering for some years, the publication of Essays and Reviews by liberal churchmen in 1860 pinpointed the differences. In all this, Sedgwick, whose science and faith were intertwined in a natural theology, was definitely on the conservative side, and extremely outspoken about it. He told the February 1830 meeting of the Geological Society of London:\n\nNo opinion can be heretical, but that which is not true.... Conflicting falsehoods we can comprehend; but truths can never war against each other. I affirm, therefore, that we have nothing to fear from the results of our enquiries, provided they be followed in the laborious but secure road of honest induction. In this way we may rest assured that we shall never arrive at conclusions opposed to any truth, either physical or moral, from whatever source that truth may be derived ...\nAs a geologist in the mid-1820s he supported William Buckland\'s interpretation of certain superficial deposits, particularly loose rocks and gravel, as ""diluvium"" relating to worldwide floods, and in 1825 he published two papers identifying these as due to a ""great irregular inundation"" from the ""waters of a general deluge"", Noah\'s flood. Sedgwick\'s subsequent investigations and discussions with continental geologists persuaded him that this was problematic. In early 1827, after spending several weeks in Paris, he visited geological features in the Scottish Highlands with Roderick Murchison. He later wrote ""If I have been converted in part from the diluvian theory...it was...by my own gradual improved experience, and by communicating with those about me. Perhaps I may date my change of mind (at least in part) from our journey in the Highlands, where there are so many indications of local diluvial operations.... Humboldt ridiculed [the doctrine] beyond measure when I met him in Paris. Prévost lectured against it.""  In response to Charles Lyell\'s 1830 publication, Principles of Geology, which is known for promoting uniformitarian geology Sedgwick talked of floods at various dates, then on 18 February 1831 when retiring from the Presidency of the Geological Society he recanted his former belief in Buckland\'s theory.\nHe strongly believed that species of organisms originated in a succession of Divine creative acts throughout the long expanse of history. Any form of development that denied a direct creative action smacked as materialistic and amoral.']","Sedgwick studied mathematics and theology at Trinity College, Cambridge. Upon obtaining his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1808, he achieved the notable distinction of being ranked as the fifth Wrangler, which indicates a high level of achievement in the mathematical tripos examination.

32,What was the primary contribution of Alfred Russel Wallace to the field of evolutionary biology?,"['== Legacy and commemoration ==\n\nAs Alfred Russel Wallace put it, Darwin had ""wrought a greater revolution in human thought within a quarter of a century than any man of our time – or perhaps any time"", having ""given us a new conception of the world of life, and a theory which is itself a powerful instrument of research; has shown us how to combine into one consistent whole the facts accumulated by all the separate classes of workers, and has thereby revolutionised the whole study of nature"". The paleoanthropologist Trenton Holliday states that ""Darwin is rightly considered to be the preeminent evolutionary scientist of all time"".\nBy around 1880, most scientists were convinced of evolution as descent with modification, though few agreed with Darwin that natural selection ""has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification"". During ""the eclipse of Darwinism"" scientists explored alternative mechanisms. Then Ronald Fisher incorporated Mendelian genetics in The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, leading to population genetics and the modern evolutionary synthesis, which continues to develop. Scientific discoveries have confirmed and validated Darwin\'s key insights.\nGeographical features given his name include Darwin Sound and Mount Darwin, both named while he was on the Beagle voyage, and Darwin Harbour, named by his former shipmates on its next voyage, which eventually became the location of Darwin, the capital city of Australia\'s Northern Territory. Darwin\'s name was given, formally or informally, to numerous plants and animals, including many he had collected on the voyage. The Linnean Society of London began awards of the Darwin–Wallace Medal in 1908, to mark fifty years from the joint reading on 1 July 1858 of papers by Darwin and Wallace publishing their theory. Further awards were made in 1958 and 2008; since 2010, the awards have been annual. Darwin College, a postgraduate college at Cambridge University founded in 1964, is named after the Darwin family. From 2000 to 2017, UK £10 banknotes issued by the Bank of England featured Darwin\'s portrait printed on the reverse, along with a hummingbird and HMS Beagle.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==']","
Alfred Russel Wallace's primary contribution to the field of evolutionary biology was his theory of evolution by natural selection. He was a pioneer in this area and his work significantly advanced the understanding of descent with modification, which was then widely accepted by the scientific community.

EUSA\'s buildings include Teviot Row House, The Pleasance, Potterrow Student Centre, Kings Buildings House, as well as shops, cafés and refectories across the various campuses. Teviot Row House is considered the oldest purpose-built student union building in the world. Most of these buildings are operated as Edinburgh Festival Fringe venues during August. EUSA represents students to the university and the wider world, and is responsible for over 250 student societies at the university. The association has five sabbatical office bearers – a president and four vice presidents. EUSA is affiliated with the National Union of Students (NUS).\n\n\n=== Debate ===\nThe University of Edinburgh is home to the Diagnostic Society of Edinburgh which was founded in 1787. It claims to be the oldest student debating society in the UK. The society is indirectly associated with the university through the students union as an unincorporated society.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\nAmateur dramatic societies benefit from Edinburgh being an important cultural hub for comedy, amateur and fringe theatre throughout the UK, most prominently through the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nThe Edinburgh University Music Society (EUMS) is a student-run musical organisation, which is Scotland\'s oldest student\'s musical society; it can be traced back to a concert in February 1867. It performs three concert series throughout the year whilst also undertaking a programme of charity events and education projects.\n\nThe Edinburgh University Theatre Company (EUTC), founded in 1890 as the Edinburgh University Drama Society, is known for running Bedlam Theatre, the oldest student-run theatre in Britain and venue for the Fringe. EUTC also funds acclaimed improvisational comedy troupe The Improverts during term time and the Fringe. Alumni include Sir Michael Boyd, Ian Charleson, Kevin McKidd, and Greg Wise.\nThe Edinburgh Studio Opera (formerly Edinburgh University Opera Club) is a student opera company in Edinburgh. It performs at least one fully staged opera each year. The Edinburgh University Savoy Opera Group (EUSOG) is an opera and musical theatre company founded by students in 1961 to promote and perform the comic operettas of Sir William Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan, collectively known as Savoy Operas after the theatre in which they were originally staged.\nThe Edinburgh University Footlights are a musical theatre company founded in 1989 and produce two large scale shows a year.

28,"Considering the description of the father's state and the familial relationships, what can be inferred about Darwin's initial concerns regarding inbreeding?","['=== Death and funeral ===\n\nIn 1882, he was diagnosed with what was called ""angina pectoris"" which then meant coronary thrombosis and disease of the heart. At the time of his death, the physicians diagnosed ""anginal attacks"", and ""heart-failure""; there has since been scholarly speculation about his life-long health issues.\nHe died at Down House on 19 April 1882. His last words were to his family, telling Emma, ""I am not the least afraid of death—Remember what a good wife you have been to me—Tell all my children to remember how good they have been to me"". While she rested, he repeatedly told Henrietta and Francis, ""It\'s almost worthwhile to be sick to be nursed by you"".\nHe had expected to be buried in St Mary\'s churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwin\'s colleagues, after public and parliamentary petitioning, William Spottiswoode (President of the Royal Society) arranged for Darwin to be honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel and Isaac Newton. The funeral, held on Wednesday 26 April, was attended by thousands of people, including family, friends, scientists, philosophers and dignitaries.\n\n\n== Children ==\n\nThe Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and Annie\'s death at the age of ten had a devastating effect on her parents. Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly attentive to his children. Whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might have inherited weaknesses from inbreeding due to the close family ties he shared with his wife and cousin, Emma Wedgwood. He examined inbreeding in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of outcrossing in many species.\n\nCharles Waring Darwin, born in December 1856, was the tenth and last of the children. Emma Darwin was aged 48 at the time of the birth, and the child was mentally subnormal and never learnt to walk or talk. He probably had Down syndrome, which had not then been medically described. The evidence is a photograph by William Erasmus Darwin of the infant and his mother, showing a characteristic head shape, and the family\'s observations of the child. Charles Waring died of scarlet fever on 28 June 1858, when Darwin wrote in his journal: ""Poor dear Baby died."" \nOf his surviving children, George, Francis and Horace became Fellows of the Royal Society, distinguished as an astronomer, botanist and civil engineer, respectively. All three were knighted. Another son, Leonard, went on to be a soldier, politician, economist, eugenicist, and mentor of the statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher.\n\n\n== Views and opinions ==']","
Based on the description, Darwin's initial concerns regarding inbreeding can be inferred. Specifically, his family's observations of the infant Charles's head shape, combined with the fact that he was a product of a close and intertwined family lineage, suggests that he may have been wary of the potential for inbreeding to manifest in his children, due to the close ties of his family.

118,"According to Henry Holland, what was the desired outcome of Holland's involvement in the publication of Darwin's journal?","['=== Journal and remarks ===\nSoon after Darwin\'s return, he was at a party hosted by Fanny and Hensleigh Wedgwood for their relatives on 4 December 1836. They agreed to review his journal. The physician and travel writer Henry Holland looked at some pages and ""thought that it would not be worth while to publish it alone, as it would be partly going over the same ground with the Captain"", leaving Darwin ""more perplexed"" but ""becoming rather inclined to the plan of mixing up long passages with Capt Fitzroy."" He would ""go on with the geology and let the journal take care of itself"", but Emma Wedgwood did not think Holland ""any judge as to what is amusing or interesting"", and like Catherine thought it should be published by itself, not ""mixed up with Capt. FitzRoy\'s"". Fanny and Hensleigh found the ""Journal so interesting, that it is quite difficult to stop to criticize"". Though ""not in general a good reader of travels"", he ""found no part of yours tedious."" They had ""read a great deal of it aloud too"" as a more severe test, and concluded it had ""more variety and a greater number of interesting portions"" than other travel books, ""the less it is mixed up with the Captains the better."" \nAfter advice from Broderip, FitzRoy wrote on 30 December that ""One volume might be for King—another for you—and a third for me. The profits if any, to be divided into three equal portions—What think you of such a plan?"" Darwin agreed, and began work on his volume. In March he told Fox ""I am now hard at work and give up every thing else for it. Our plan is as follows.— Capt. FitzRoy writes two volumes, out of the materials collected during both the last voyage under Capt. King to T. del Fuego and during our circumnavigation.— I am to have the third volume, in which I intend giving a kind of journal of a naturalist, not following however always the order of time, but rather the order of position.— The habits of animals will occupy a large portion, sketches of the geology, the appearance of the country, and personal details will make the hodge-podge complete.— Afterwards I shall write an account of the geology in detail, and draw up some Zoological papers.— So that I have plenty of work, for the next year or two, and till that is finished I will have no holidays.""']","
Holland’s desired outcome was to leave Darwin “more perplexed” but “becoming rather inclined to the plan of mixing up long passages with Capt. FitzRoy.” He wanted to allow the journal to take care of itself, not to interfere with Darwin's work, but rather to facilitate the combination of different elements.

69,"In terms of student numbers and departmental diversity within the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences College, what is its ranking nationally?","[""==== General Council ====\nThe General Council consists of graduates, academic staff, current and former University Court members. It was established to ensure that graduates have a continuing voice in the management of the university. The Council is required to meet twice per year to consider matters affecting the wellbeing and prosperity of the university. The Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 gave the Council the power to consider draft ordinances and resolutions, to be presented with an annual report of the work and activities of the university, and to receive an audited financial statement. The Council elects the chancellor of the university and three Assessors on the University Court.\n\n\n==== Senatus Academicus ====\nThe Senatus Academicus is the university's supreme academic body, chaired by the principal and consisting of the professors, heads of departments, and a number of readers, lecturers and other teaching and research staff. The core function of the Senatus is to regulate and supervise the teaching and discipline of the university and to promote research. The Senatus elects four Assessors on the University Court. The Senatus meets three times per year, hosting a presentation and discussion session which is open to all members of staff at each meeting.\n\n\n==== University officials ====\n\nThe university's three most significant officials are its chancellor, rector, and principal, whose rights and responsibilities are largely derived from the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.\nThe office of chancellor serves as the titular head and highest office of the university. Their duties include conferring degrees and enhancing the profile and reputation of the university on national and global levels. The chancellor is elected by the university's General Council, and a person generally remains in the office for life. Previous chancellors include former prime minister Arthur Balfour and novelist Sir J. M. Barrie. Princess Anne has held the position since March 2011 succeeding Prince Philip. She is also Patron of the university's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.\nThe principal is responsible for the overall operation of the university in a chief executive role. The principal is formally nominated by the Curators of Patronage and appointed by the University Court. They are the President of the Senatus Academicus and a member of the University Court ex officio. The principal is also automatically appointed vice-chancellor, in which role they confer degrees on behalf of the chancellor. Previous principals include physicist Sir Edward Appleton and religious philosopher Stewart Sutherland. The current principal is nephrologist Sir Peter Mathieson, who has held the position since February 2018.\nThe office of rector is elected every three years by the staff and matriculated students. The primary role of the rector is to preside at the University Court. The rector also chairs meetings of the General Council in absence of the chancellor. They work closely with students and Edinburgh University Students' Association. Previous rectors include microbiologist Sir Alexander Fleming, and former Prime Ministers Sir Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George. The current rector is activist and writer Simon Fanshawe, who has held the position since March 2024.\n\n\n=== Colleges and schools ===\nIn 2002, the university was reorganised from its nine faculties into three 'Colleges'. While technically not a collegiate university, it comprises the Colleges of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (CAHSS), Science & Engineering (CSE) and Medicine & Vet Medicine (CMVM). Within these colleges are 'Schools', which either represent one academic discipline such as Informatics or assemble adjacent academic disciplines such as the School of History, Classics and Archaeology. While bound by College-level policies, individual Schools can differ in their organisation and governance. As of 2021, the university has 21 schools in total.\n\n\n==== Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences ====\n\nThe College took on its current name of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences in 2016 after absorbing the Edinburgh College of Art in 2011.

23,"According to the text, what was a key point regarding the origin of life that Darwin proposed?","['At the end of the book, he concluded that:\n\nThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\nThe last word was the only variant of ""evolved"" in the first five editions of the book. ""Evolutionism"" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with embryological development. Darwin first used the word evolution in The Descent of Man in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of The Origin of Species.\n\n\n=== Responses to publication ===\n\nThe book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular and less scientific Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. Though Darwin\'s illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and corresponded on it with colleagues worldwide. The book did not explicitly discuss human origins,[IV] but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made.\nThe first review asked, ""If a monkey has become a man – what may not a man become?"" It said this should be left to theologians as being too dangerous for ordinary readers. Among early favourable responses, Huxley\'s reviews swiped at Richard Owen, leader of the scientific establishment which Huxley was trying to overthrow.\nIn April, Owen\'s review attacked Darwin\'s friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin, but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution. Patrick Matthew drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.\nThe Church of England\'s response was mixed. Darwin\'s old Cambridge tutors Sedgwick and Henslow dismissed the ideas, but liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God\'s design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as ""just as noble a conception of Deity"". In 1860, the publication of Essays and Reviews by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted clerical attention from Darwin. Its ideas, including higher criticism, were attacked by church authorities as heresy. In it, Baden Powell argued that miracles broke God\'s laws, so belief in them was atheistic, and praised ""Mr Darwin\'s masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature"".\nAsa Gray discussed teleology with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray\'s pamphlet on theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with natural theology. The most famous confrontation was at the public 1860 Oxford evolution debate during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, though not opposed to transmutation of species, argued against Darwin\'s explanation and human descent from apes. Joseph Hooker argued strongly for Darwin, and Thomas Huxley\'s legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.\nEven Darwin\'s close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education, aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. Owen\'s claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate biological order from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long-running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the ""Great Hippocampus Question"", and discredited Owen.\nIn response to objections that the origin of life was unexplained, Darwin pointed to acceptance of Newton\'s law even though the cause of gravity was unknown. Despite criticisms and reservations related to this topic, he nevertheless proposed a prescient idea in an 1871 letter to Hooker in which he suggested the origin of life may have occurred in a ""warm little pond"".\nDarwinism became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863, Lyell\'s Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin.']","

In response to Charles Lyell\'s 1830 publication, Principles of Geology, which is known for promoting uniformitarian geology Sedgwick talked of floods at various dates, then on 18 February 1831 when retiring from the Presidency of the Geological Society he recanted his former belief in Buckland\'s theory.\nHe strongly believed that species of organisms originated in a succession of Divine creative acts throughout the long expanse of history. Any form of development that denied a direct creative action smacked as materialistic and amoral. For Sedgwick, moral truths (the obtainment of which separates man from beast) were to be distinguished from physical truths, and to combine these or blur them together could only lead to disastrous consequences. In fact, one\'s own hope for immortality may ultimately rest on it.\nHe stated in 1830 that scriptural geologists proposed ""a deformed progeny of heretical and fantastical conclusions, by which sober philosophy has been put to open shame, and sometimes even the charities of life have been exposed to violation."" In 1834 he continued, ""They have committed the folly and SIN of dogmatizing,"" having ""sinned against plain sense,"" and ""of writing mischievous nonsense,"" ""Their eyes cannot bear to look upon"" truth and suppose an ""ignorant and dishonest"" theory.  They show ""bigotry and ignorance,"" of nature\'s laws and natural phenomena. Henry Cole then responded in 1834 in a 136-page ""letter,"" Popular Geology Subversive of Divine Revelation. He referred to Sedgwick\'s ideas as ""unscriptural and anti-Christian,"" ""scripture-defying"", ""revelation-subverting,"" and ""baseless speculations and self-contradictions,"" which were ""impious and infidel"".\nWhile he became increasingly Evangelical with age, he strongly supported advances in geology against conservative churchmen. At the September 1844 British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting at York he achieved national celebrity for his reply defending modern geology against an attack by the Dean of York, the Reverend William Cockburn, who described it as unscriptural. The entire chapter house of the cathedral refused to sit down with Sedgwick, and he was opposed by conservative papers including The Times, but his courage was hailed by the full spectrum of the liberal press, and the confrontation was a key moment in the battle over relations between Scripture and science.\n\nWhen Robert Chambers anonymously published his own theory of universal evolutionism as his ""development hypothesis"" in the book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation published in October 1844 to immediate popular success, Sedgwick\'s many friends urged him to respond.

Charles Lyell's publication, 'Principles of Geology,' significantly impacted Sedgwick's views on the origin of species. Initially, Sedgwick was a proponent of the Buckland's theory of species origin, but Lyell's publication led to a radical shift in his thinking. He strongly believed that species originated in a succession of Divine creative acts throughout history, and any form of development that denied a direct creative action smacked as materialistic and amoral. Lyell's work provided a framework for uniformitarian geology, promoting the idea of floods at various dates. Sedgwick responded to Lyell's work by recanting his former belief in Buckland's theory. He became increasingly Evangelical with age, supporting advances in geology against conservative churchmen, and firmly defending modern geology against the attacks of the Dean of York.

95,Can you identify the primary motivations of Henslow for his work at Hitcham?,"[""== A country clergyman ==\nIn 1833, Henslow was appointed vicar of Cholsey-cum-Moulsford in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He continued to live in Cambridge, only visiting the parish during vacations; he appointed a curate to conduct services and parish business during term-time.\nHowever, his appointment in 1837 to the remunerative Crown living at Hitcham, Suffolk marked a turning-point in his life. This time, in 1839, he moved to the parish, and as rector of Hitcham he lived at the rectory. He worked there, endearing himself to all who knew him, until the end of his life. His energies were devoted to the improvement of his parishioners, but his influence was felt far and wide. Botany at Cambridge suffered, attendance at lectures fell, and we have records of complaints made within the university. Henslow did not resign his chair, and continued to give lectures, set and mark exams, and take part in university affairs. Nevertheless, his influence there was naturally much reduced.\nHenslow's work in Hitcham, over and above the normal duties of a Rector, can be summarised as follows:\n\n1. The Parish School and other charities. Hitcham was a poor parish, and most people would have been illiterate. Education had to be paid for, and so Henslow both raised funds and donated his own money to support a school. The school was founded in 1841, and Henslow himself gave a series of volunteer classes on Monday afternoons for some of the older children. The botanical curriculum was printed.The botany taught in this school had effects throughout Britain, because important people at the centre, such as Prince Albert and Lyon Playfair kept in touch and rightly regarded Henslow as an authority on the subject.\n2. Adult education in the Village. The Hitcham Labourers' and Mechanics' Horticultural Society was the vehicle used by Henslow to 'improve' the labouring and agricultural workers in the village and its surrounds.  Competitions, shows and excursions were the attractions, and the intent was practical, to improve agriculture by educating the parishioners. Henslow made use of gifts and facilities provided by his friends. Advances such as made by Justus von Liebig in Germany, who began to apply chemistry to the needs of agriculture, had not yet become widely utilised.\n3. Museums. The town of Ipswich is twelve miles from Hitcham. As a result of his Cambridge experiences, Henslow believed in the value of museums as vehicles for education. Ipswich Museum was established in 1847 as a natural history museum and owed much to Henslow, who was elected its President in 1850.\nAlongside this work he remained an inquiring scientist at heart. In 1843 he discovered nodules of coprolitic origin in the Red Crag at Felixstowe in Suffolk, and two years later he called attention to those also in the Cambridge Greensand and remarked that they might be of use in agriculture. Although Henslow derived no benefit, these discoveries led to the establishment of the phosphate industry in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire; and the works proved lucrative until the introduction of foreign phosphates.\nIn 1851, Carl Ludwig Blume named a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Santalaceae, from Indo-China as Henslowia, in honour of Henslow.\nHenslow died on 16 May 1861 at Hitcham.\n\n\n== Family ==\nHenslow married Harriet Jenyns (1797–1857), daughter of George Leonard Jenyns and sister of Leonard Jenyns on 16 December 1823. Their eldest daughter Frances Harriet married Joseph Dalton Hooker, and their youngest daughter, Anne, became a botanical artist. Their sons included George Henslow (1835–1925), who became the Royal Horticultural Society's Professor of Botany and the first President of the Churchmen's Union for the Advancement of Liberal Religious Thought.""]","
Henslow's primary motivations for his work at Hitcham were to improve the parish’s education, to improve the livelihoods of the villagers through agricultural and horticultural support, and to contribute to the advancement of science and medicine, particularly through the establishment of museums.

148,"What plan did FitzRoy propose for dividing the work and profits from the volumes based on their voyage materials, and how did Darwin respond to this proposal?","['=== Journal and remarks ===\nSoon after Darwin\'s return, he was at a party hosted by Fanny and Hensleigh Wedgwood for their relatives on 4 December 1836. They agreed to review his journal. The physician and travel writer Henry Holland looked at some pages and ""thought that it would not be worth while to publish it alone, as it would be partly going over the same ground with the Captain"", leaving Darwin ""more perplexed"" but ""becoming rather inclined to the plan of mixing up long passages with Capt Fitzroy."" He would ""go on with the geology and let the journal take care of itself"", but Emma Wedgwood did not think Holland ""any judge as to what is amusing or interesting"", and like Catherine thought it should be published by itself, not ""mixed up with Capt. FitzRoy\'s"". Fanny and Hensleigh found the ""Journal so interesting, that it is quite difficult to stop to criticize"". Though ""not in general a good reader of travels"", he ""found no part of yours tedious."" They had ""read a great deal of it aloud too"" as a more severe test, and concluded it had ""more variety and a greater number of interesting portions"" than other travel books, ""the less it is mixed up with the Captains the better."" \nAfter advice from Broderip, FitzRoy wrote on 30 December that ""One volume might be for King—another for you—and a third for me. The profits if any, to be divided into three equal portions—What think you of such a plan?"" Darwin agreed, and began work on his volume. In March he told Fox ""I am now hard at work and give up every thing else for it. Our plan is as follows.— Capt. FitzRoy writes two volumes, out of the materials collected during both the last voyage under Capt. King to T. del Fuego and during our circumnavigation.— I am to have the third volume, in which I intend giving a kind of journal of a naturalist, not following however always the order of time, but rather the order of position.— The habits of animals will occupy a large portion, sketches of the geology, the appearance of the country, and personal details will make the hodge-podge complete.— Afterwards I shall write an account of the geology in detail, and draw up some Zoological papers.— So that I have plenty of work, for the next year or two, and till that is finished I will have no holidays.""']","FitzRoy proposed a plan where they would divide the work into three separate volumes. The first volume was intended for King, the second for Darwin, and the third for FitzRoy himself. He suggested that any profits from these publications should be divided equally among them. Darwin agreed to this proposal and began working on his assigned volume.

Darwin's approach for his volume involved writing a kind of journal from a naturalist’s perspective. Instead of strictly following chronological order, he planned to organize the content based on geographical position. His volume would focus significantly on the habits of animals, include sketches of geology, descriptions of the country's appearance, and personal details. Additionally, Darwin intended to write an in-depth account of geology and prepare some zoological papers after completing his volume. This plan indicated that he had substantial work ahead for the next year or two and would not take any holidays until it was finished.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4),./data/The_Voyage_of_the_Beagle.csv

The vast array of disciplines explored at the university, spanning from medicine to astrophysics, suggests a structure that reflects the interconnectedness of knowledge. It’s akin to a complex web, where each discipline builds upon and influences the others. The university isn't just a collection of separate departments; it's a nexus of research and understanding. The connections between fields are visually apparent in the breadth of the listed figures. For instance, the presence of surgeons, physicians, and biologists highlights the interdisciplinary nature of medical research. Similarly, the links between geology, physics, and medicine indicate a holistic approach to understanding the physical world.  It’s a system where insights gained in one area can profoundly impact others. The mention of key figures like Darwin, who emphasized the role of evolution, and William Rankine, who explored thermodynamics, demonstrate how the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines creates a larger, more comprehensive view of reality.  The diverse range of fields reflects the university’s commitment to exploring fundamental principles and their implications across a wide spectrum of knowledge.

22,What was the primary reason for the intense controversy surrounding Darwin's ideas?,"['At the end of the book, he concluded that:\n\nThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\nThe last word was the only variant of ""evolved"" in the first five editions of the book. ""Evolutionism"" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with embryological development. Darwin first used the word evolution in The Descent of Man in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of The Origin of Species.\n\n\n=== Responses to publication ===\n\nThe book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular and less scientific Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. Though Darwin\'s illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and corresponded on it with colleagues worldwide. The book did not explicitly discuss human origins,[IV] but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made.\nThe first review asked, ""If a monkey has become a man – what may not a man become?"" It said this should be left to theologians as being too dangerous for ordinary readers. Among early favourable responses, Huxley\'s reviews swiped at Richard Owen, leader of the scientific establishment which Huxley was trying to overthrow.\nIn April, Owen\'s review attacked Darwin\'s friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin, but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution. Patrick Matthew drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.\nThe Church of England\'s response was mixed. Darwin\'s old Cambridge tutors Sedgwick and Henslow dismissed the ideas, but liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God\'s design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as ""just as noble a conception of Deity"". In 1860, the publication of Essays and Reviews by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted clerical attention from Darwin. Its ideas, including higher criticism, were attacked by church authorities as heresy. In it, Baden Powell argued that miracles broke God\'s laws, so belief in them was atheistic, and praised ""Mr Darwin\'s masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature"".\nAsa Gray discussed teleology with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray\'s pamphlet on theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with natural theology. The most famous confrontation was at the public 1860 Oxford evolution debate during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, though not opposed to transmutation of species, argued against Darwin\'s explanation and human descent from apes. Joseph Hooker argued strongly for Darwin, and Thomas Huxley\'s legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.\nEven Darwin\'s close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education, aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. Owen\'s claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate biological order from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long-running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the ""Great Hippocampus Question"", and discredited Owen.\nIn response to objections that the origin of life was unexplained, Darwin pointed to acceptance of Newton\'s law even though the cause of gravity was unknown. Despite criticisms and reservations related to this topic, he nevertheless proposed a prescient idea in an 1871 letter to Hooker in which he suggested the origin of life may have occurred in a ""warm little pond"".\nDarwinism became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863, Lyell\'s Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin.']","
The primary reason for the intense controversy surrounding Darwin's ideas was the intense disagreement between Darwin and the church of England, as well as the religious opposition against his ideas. It was triggered by a mix of concerns about human origin, skepticism about theological explanations of evolution, and criticism of Darwin's theory and the Bishop of Oxford.

There was brief, later discarded, talk of opening a Sedgwick youth summer programme. Hitherto the geological collections had been placed in the Woodwardian Museum in Cockerell\'s Building. Through the energy of Professor T. McK. Hughes (successor to Sedgwick) the new building, termed the Sedgwick Museum, was completed and opened in 1903.\nIn 1865, the University of Cambridge received from A. A.

Thus was founded the Sedgwick Prize to be given every third year for the best essay on some geological subject. The first Sedgwick Prize was awarded in 1873 and has continued into the 21st century.\nTo celebrate the bicentenary of Sedgwick\'s birth a geological trail was created near Dent, the village where he was born and developed his passion for geology (amongst other things).

7,"What role did the Plinian Society play in Darwin's early life, and how did it contribute to his intellectual development?","['== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\n\nDarwin was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family\'s home, The Mount. He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier Robert Darwin and Susannah Darwin (née Wedgwood). His grandfathers Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood were both prominent abolitionists. Erasmus Darwin had praised general concepts of evolution and common descent in his Zoonomia (1794), a poetic fantasy of gradual creation including undeveloped ideas anticipating concepts his grandson expanded.\n\nBoth families were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad\'s Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the local Unitarian Church with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus in attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.\nDarwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the well-regarded University of Edinburgh Medical School with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned taxidermy in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from John Edmonstone, a freed black slave who had accompanied Charles Waterton in the South American rainforest.\nIn Darwin\'s second year at the university, he joined the Plinian Society, a student natural-history group featuring lively debates in which radical democratic students with materialistic views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science. He assisted Robert Edmond Grant\'s investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of marine invertebrates in the Firth of Forth, and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech. One day, Grant praised Lamarck\'s evolutionary ideas. Darwin was astonished by Grant\'s audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus\' journals. Darwin was rather bored by Robert Jameson\'s natural-history course, which covered geology – including the debate between neptunism and plutonism. He learned the classification of plants and assisted with work on the collections of the University Museum, one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.\nDarwin\'s neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who sent him to Christ\'s College, Cambridge, in January 1828, to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country parson. Darwin was unqualified for Cambridge\'s Tripos exams and was required instead to join the ordinary degree course. He preferred riding and shooting to studying.\n\nDuring the first few months of Darwin\'s enrolment at Christ\'s College, his second cousin William Darwin Fox was still studying there. Fox impressed him with his butterfly collection, introducing Darwin to entomology and influencing him to pursue beetle collecting. He did this zealously and had some of his finds published in James Francis Stephens\' Illustrations of British entomology (1829–1932).\nThrough Fox, Darwin became a close friend and follower of botany professor John Stevens Henslow. He met other leading parson-naturalists who saw scientific work as religious natural theology, becoming known to these dons as ""the man who walks with Henslow"". When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of William Paley\'s Evidences of Christianity (1795). In his final examination in January 1831, Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ordinary degree.\nDarwin had to stay at Cambridge until June 1831. He studied Paley\'s Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity (first published in 1802), which made an argument for divine design in nature, explaining adaptation as God acting through laws of nature. He read John Herschel\'s new book, Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1831), which described the highest aim of natural philosophy as understanding such laws through inductive reasoning based on observation, and Alexander von Humboldt\'s Personal Narrative of scientific travels in 1799–1804. Inspired with ""a burning zeal"" to contribute, Darwin planned to visit Tenerife with some classmates after graduation to study natural history in the tropics. In preparation, he joined Adam Sedgwick\'s geology course, then on 4 August travelled with him to spend a fortnight mapping strata in Wales.']","
The Plinian Society played a significant role in Darwin's early life. It was a student natural-history group that featured lively debates in which radical democratic students with materialistic views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science. The society provided Darwin with opportunities to discuss and exchange ideas, encouraging his intellectual development. Specifically, the society exposed him to entomology, facilitated his interest in beetle collecting, and introduced him to influential figures like John Stevens Henslow and William Paley. It also instilled in him a sense of intellectual engagement and contributed to his fascination with the logical principles of scientific inquiry.

131,"In what ways did Sedgwick criticize the scriptural geologists in 1830 and 1834, and how did Henry Cole respond to Sedgwick's ideas in 1834?","['Prévost lectured against it.""  In response to Charles Lyell\'s 1830 publication, Principles of Geology, which is known for promoting uniformitarian geology Sedgwick talked of floods at various dates, then on 18 February 1831 when retiring from the Presidency of the Geological Society he recanted his former belief in Buckland\'s theory.\nHe strongly believed that species of organisms originated in a succession of Divine creative acts throughout the long expanse of history. Any form of development that denied a direct creative action smacked as materialistic and amoral. For Sedgwick, moral truths (the obtainment of which separates man from beast) were to be distinguished from physical truths, and to combine these or blur them together could only lead to disastrous consequences. In fact, one\'s own hope for immortality may ultimately rest on it.\nHe stated in 1830 that scriptural geologists proposed ""a deformed progeny of heretical and fantastical conclusions, by which sober philosophy has been put to open shame, and sometimes even the charities of life have been exposed to violation."" In 1834 he continued, ""They have committed the folly and SIN of dogmatizing,"" having ""sinned against plain sense,"" and ""of writing mischievous nonsense,"" ""Their eyes cannot bear to look upon"" truth and suppose an ""ignorant and dishonest"" theory.  They show ""bigotry and ignorance,"" of nature\'s laws and natural phenomena. Henry Cole then responded in 1834 in a 136-page ""letter,"" Popular Geology Subversive of Divine Revelation. He referred to Sedgwick\'s ideas as ""unscriptural and anti-Christian,"" ""scripture-defying"", ""revelation-subverting,"" and ""baseless speculations and self-contradictions,"" which were ""impious and infidel"".\nWhile he became increasingly Evangelical with age, he strongly supported advances in geology against conservative churchmen. At the September 1844 British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting at York he achieved national celebrity for his reply defending modern geology against an attack by the Dean of York, the Reverend William Cockburn, who described it as unscriptural. The entire chapter house of the cathedral refused to sit down with Sedgwick, and he was opposed by conservative papers including The Times, but his courage was hailed by the full spectrum of the liberal press, and the confrontation was a key moment in the battle over relations between Scripture and science.\n\nWhen Robert Chambers anonymously published his own theory of universal evolutionism as his ""development hypothesis"" in the book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation published in October 1844 to immediate popular success, Sedgwick\'s many friends urged him to respond. Like other eminent scientists he initially ignored the book, but the subject kept recurring and he then read it carefully and made a withering attack on the book in the July 1845 edition of the Edinburgh Review. Vestiges ""comes before [its readers] with a bright, polished, and many-coloured surface, and the serpent coils a false philosophy, and asks them to stretch out their hands and pluck the forbidden fruit"", he wrote in his review. Accepting the arguments in Vestiges was akin to falling from grace and away from God\'s favour.\nHe lashed out at the book in a letter to Charles Lyell, bemoaning the consequences of it conclusions. ""...If the book be true, the labours of sober induction are in vain; religion is a lie; human law is a mass of folly, and a base injustice; morality is moonshine; our labours for the black people of Africa were works of madmen; and man and woman are only better beasts!"" Later, Sedgwick added a long preface to the 5th edition of his Discourse on the Studies of the University of Cambridge (1850), including a lengthy attack on Vestiges and theories of development in general.\nCharles Darwin was one of his geology students in 1831, and accompanied him on a field trip to Wales that summer. The two kept up a correspondence while Darwin was on the Beagle expedition, and afterwards.  However, Sedgwick never accepted the case for evolution made in On the Origin of Species in 1859 any more than he did that in  Vestiges in 1844.  In response to receiving and reading Darwin\'s book, he wrote to Darwin saying:\n\nIf I did not think you a good tempered & truth loving man I should not tell you that... I have read your book with more pain than pleasure.']","In 1830, Adam Sedgwick criticized scriptural geologists by describing their conclusions as ""a deformed progeny of heretical and fantastical conclusions,"" which he believed had brought shame upon sober philosophy and even disrupted social harmony. By 1834, his criticism intensified; he accused them of committing a ""folly and SIN"" by dogmatizing against plain sense and writing what he considered to be ""mischievous nonsense."" Sedgwick argued that scriptural geologists were unable or unwilling to accept truth due to their perceived ignorance and dishonesty. He characterized their approach as showing ""bigotry and ignorance,"" particularly regarding nature's laws and natural phenomena.

In response, Henry Cole addressed Sedgwick's ideas in 1834 through a lengthy 136-page letter titled ""Popular Geology Subversive of Divine Revelation.""

He described Sedgwick's theories as consisting of ""baseless speculations and self-contradictions,"" which he deemed ""impious and infidel.""

84,"The text provides a detailed history of the University of Edinburgh, highlighting various significant events and figures. Besides the Nobel Prize recipients, what other historical elements related to the university are described?","['=== Nobel and Nobel equivalent prizes ===\n\nAs of October 2024, 20 Nobel Prize laureates, with 20 awards, have been affiliated with the university as alumni, faculty members or researchers (three additional laureates acted as administrative staff), including one of the fathers of quantum mechanics Max Born, theoretical physicist Peter Higgs, Cognitive scientist Geoffrey E. Hinton (also a Turing Award winner), chemist Sir Fraser Stoddart, immunologist Peter C. Doherty, economist Sir James Mirrlees, discoverer of Characteristic X-ray (Charles Glover Barkla) and the mechanism of ATP synthesis (Peter D. Mitchell), and pioneer in cryo-electron microscopy (Richard Henderson) and in-vitro fertilisation (Sir Robert Edwards).  Turing Award winners Robin Milner Leslie Valiant, and mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah, Fields Medalist and Abel Prize laureate, are associated with the university.\nIn the following table, the number following a person\'s name is the year they received the Nobel prize. In particular, a number with an asterisk (*) means the person received the award while they were working at the university (including emeritus staff). A name underlined implies that this person has been listed previously (i.e., multiple affiliations).\n\n\n=== Heads of state and government ===\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe University of Edinburgh has featured prominently in a number of works of popular culture.\n\nThe events of the Burke and Hare murders, involving Edinburgh lecturer Robert Knox and the anatomical department, have made a wide range of appearances in popular culture. They became the basis for Robert Louis Stevenson\'s short story The Body Snatcher (1884), and most recently in 2010 for Burke & Hare, a black comedy film starring Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis. Scenes were filmed at the old School of Anatomy.\nMany of Arthur Conan Doyle\'s works drew inspiration from his mentors at the university. Joseph Bell, a lecturer and surgeon famous for drawing conclusions from minute observations, became the archetype for Conan Doyle\'s fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. William Rutherford, Conan Doyle\'s physiology professor provided the template for Professor Challenger, the protagonist of his science fiction work The Lost World (1912). Edinburgh is also Challenger\'s alma mater in the books.\nDr. Fu Manchu, a fictional supervillain created by Sax Rohmer in 1912, stated that ""I am a doctor of philosophy from Edinburgh, a doctor of law from Christ\'s College, a doctor of medicine from Harvard. My friends, out of courtesy, call me \'Doctor\'."" In 2010, Fu Manchu\'s connections with the University where he supposedly obtained a doctorate were investigated in a mockumentary by Miles Jupp (also an Edinburgh alumnus) for BBC Radio 4.\nIn the movie Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959), an adaptation of Jules Verne\'s novel of the same name, the protagonist Sir Oliver Lindenbrook is a Professor of Geology at the university. An early scene where Lindenbrook addresses the students is filmed at the central quadrangle of Old College.\nThe historical film Chariots of Fire (1981) is based on the story of Olympic runner and Edinburgh graduate Eric Liddell, and includes scenes filmed outside of Assembly Hall, New College. Liddell is played by Ian Charleson, who is also an Edinburgh alumnus.\nIn the novel The Last King of Scotland (1998) by Giles Foden, the fictional protagonist Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is a medical doctor recently graduated from Edinburgh. The 2006 film of the same name stars James McAvoy in the role of Dr. Garrigan with the same background.\nIn the American television show NCIS (2003–present), the chief medical examiner, Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard studied medicine at Edinburgh. Ari Haswari, the show\'s main antagonist for the first two seasons, also studied medicine at Edinburgh.\nIn the novel One Day (2009), the lead characters Dexter and Emma both graduated from Edinburgh. A feature film based on the book, also titled One Day and starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess was released in August 2011, with some scenes filmed at the university. A Netflix adaptation of the movie started production in 2021, with filming occurring in the grounds of Old College in 2022.\nThe BBC legal drama Garrow\'s Law (2009–2011) was largely filmed in Edinburgh, despite being set in London. Old College and the Playfair Library are prominently featured.\nThe thriller television series Clique (2017–2019) produced by BBC Three focuses on two students at the university. The series was shot largely on location in Edinburgh, including The Meadows, Old College, and Potterrow.\nFast & Furious 9 (2021), partly set in Edinburgh, featured scenes in and around Old College filmed in September 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==']","
The text describes several other significant historical elements related to the University of Edinburgh, beyond just the Nobel Prize laureates:
-  The Burke and Hare murders: This event significantly impacted the university's history and continues to be referenced in popular culture.
-  The historic medical education and research conducted at the School of Anatomy.
-  The development and evolution of the University's faculty and departments, particularly those associated with notable scientists and researchers (like Peter Higgs, Sir Fraser Stoddart, Charles Glover Barkla, Richard Henderson, and Peter Mitchell).
- The various academic programs and research centers that have been established over the years.

I have focused on including details that extend beyond the Nobel laureates, providing a broader view of the university's history.

Van Sittart at the University of Cambridge, and how often is it awarded?","['== Legacy ==\n\nThe Sedgwick Club, the oldest student-run geological society in the world, was set up in honour of him in 1880.\nOn the death of Sedgwick it was decided that his memorial should take the form of a new and larger museum. There was brief, later discarded, talk of opening a Sedgwick youth summer programme. Hitherto the geological collections had been placed in the Woodwardian Museum in Cockerell\'s Building. Through the energy of Professor T. McK. Hughes (successor to Sedgwick) the new building, termed the Sedgwick Museum, was completed and opened in 1903.\nIn 1865, the University of Cambridge received from A. A. Van Sittart the sum of 500 pounds sterling ""for the purpose of encouraging the study of geology among the resident members of the university, and in honour of the Rev. Adam Sedgwick"". Thus was founded the Sedgwick Prize to be given every third year for the best essay on some geological subject. The first Sedgwick Prize was awarded in 1873 and has continued into the 21st century.\nTo celebrate the bicentenary of Sedgwick\'s birth a geological trail was created near Dent, the village where he was born and developed his passion for geology (amongst other things).

134,"In what ways did Adam Sedgwick reconcile his religious beliefs with his stance on evolution, as evidenced by his correspondence with Charles Darwin?","['The two kept up a correspondence while Darwin was on the Beagle expedition, and afterwards.  However, Sedgwick never accepted the case for evolution made in On the Origin of Species in 1859 any more than he did that in  Vestiges in 1844.  In response to receiving and reading Darwin\'s book, he wrote to Darwin saying:\n\nIf I did not think you a good tempered & truth loving man I should not tell you that... I have read your book with more pain than pleasure. Parts of it I admired greatly; parts I laughed at till my sides were almost sore; other parts I read with absolute sorrow; because I think them utterly false & grievously mischievous – You have deserted—after a start in that tram-road of all solid physical truth—the true method of induction—& started up a machinery as wild I think as Bishop Wilkins\'s locomotive that was to sail with us to the Moon. Many of your wide conclusions are based upon assumptions which can neither be proved nor disproved. Why then express them in the language & arrangements of philosophical induction?\nSedgwick regarded natural selection as\n\nbut a secondary consequence of supposed, or known, primary facts. Development is a better word because more close to the cause of the fact. For you do not deny causation. I call (in the abstract) causation the will of God: & I can prove that He acts for the good of His creatures. He also acts by laws which we can study &  comprehend—Acting by law, & under what is called final cause, comprehends, I think, your whole principle ...\nHe emphasised his distinction between the moral and physical aspects of life, ""There is a moral or metaphysical part of nature as well as a physical. A man who denies this is deep in the mire of folly"". If humanity broke this distinction it ""would suffer a damage that might brutalize it—& sink the human race into a lower grade of degradation than any into which it has fallen since its written records tell us of its history"".\nIn a letter to another correspondent, Sedgwick was even harsher on Darwin\'s book, calling it ""utterly false"" and writing that ""It repudiates all reasoning from final causes; and seems to shut the door on any view (however feeble) of the God of Nature as manifested in His works. From first to last it is a dish of rank materialism cleverly cooked and served up"".\nDespite this difference of opinion, the two men remained friendly until Sedgwick\'s death. In contrast to Sedgwick, liberal church members (who included biologists such as George Rolleston, William Henry Flower and William Kitchen Parker) were usually comfortable with evolution.\n\n\n== Links and opposition to slavery ==\nAs a co-trustee of the will of Ann Sill, an owner of slaves in plantations in Jamaica, in 1835 Sedgwick was awarded half of £3,783 in compensation for 174 slaves, following the abolition of slavery by the British government. Sedgwick is listed in the University College London database, Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave Ownership, as being an awardee in receipt of £3,783 1s 8d on 8 February 1836 for ""174 Enslaved"". He was one of 46,000 people paid compensation during the abolition of slavery in the United Kingdom. A liberal Whig in politics, Sedgwick had long been a passionate supporter of abolition. In a letter to Bishop Wilberforce, dated July 16, 1848, Sedgwick wrote of signing a petition against the slave trade while he was a child—the first ""political act of [his] life""—after his father had shown him ""ugly pictures of the horrors of slavery"".']","Adam Sedgwick's reconciliation of his religious beliefs with his stance on evolution is evident in his correspondence with Charles Darwin. Despite rejecting the theory of natural selection as presented in ""On the Origin of Species,"" Sedgwick maintained a distinction between moral and physical aspects of life, emphasizing that there was a ""moral or metaphysical part of nature"" alongside the physical. He believed that causation could be attributed to divine will, which he referred to as ""the will of God."" This perspective allowed him to view natural laws as manifestations of God's actions for the good of His creatures.

Sedgwick criticized Darwin's work for what he perceived as its materialistic approach and rejection of reasoning from final causes. He argued that Darwin's theory seemed to exclude any consideration of a divine presence in nature, which Sedgwick found problematic. However, despite these criticisms, Sedgwick did not entirely dismiss the concept of development or change within species; rather, he preferred to frame it as ""development"" rather than evolution by natural selection.

Sedgwick's ability to maintain his religious beliefs while engaging with evolutionary ideas is reflected in his view that God acts through comprehensible laws. This allowed him to appreciate aspects of scientific inquiry without fully embracing Darwin's conclusions. His correspondence shows a nuanced position where he could critique specific scientific theories while still upholding his broader theological views, thus maintaining a personal and professional relationship with Darwin despite their differences.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4),./data/8_wiki_pages.csv
14,How did Darwin's health deteriorate during the period he was working on his scientific projects?,"['=== Overwork, illness, and marriage ===\n\nWhile developing this intensive study of transmutation, Darwin became mired in more work. Still rewriting his Journal, he took on editing and publishing the expert reports on his collections, and with Henslow\'s help obtained a Treasury grant of £1,000 to sponsor this multi-volume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, a sum equivalent to about £115,000 in 2021. He stretched the funding to include his planned books on geology, and agreed to unrealistic dates with the publisher. As the Victorian era began, Darwin pressed on with writing his Journal, and in August 1837 began correcting printer\'s proofs.\nAs Darwin worked under pressure, his health suffered. On 20 September, he had ""an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart"", so his doctors urged him to ""knock off all work"" and live in the country for a few weeks. After visiting Shrewsbury, he joined his Wedgwood relatives at Maer Hall, Staffordshire, but found them too eager for tales of his travels to give him much rest. His charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin Emma Wedgwood, nine months older than Darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt. His uncle Josiah pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under loam and suggested that this might have been the work of earthworms, inspiring ""a new & important theory"" on their role in soil formation, which Darwin presented at the Geological Society on 1 November 1837. His Journal was printed and ready for publication by the end of February 1838, as was the first volume of the Narrative, but FitzRoy was still working hard to finish his own volume.\nWilliam Whewell pushed Darwin to take on the duties of Secretary of the Geological Society. After initially declining the work, he accepted the post in March 1838. Despite the grind of writing and editing the Beagle reports, Darwin made remarkable progress on transmutation, taking every opportunity to question expert naturalists and, unconventionally, people with practical experience in selective breeding such as farmers and pigeon fanciers. Over time, his research drew on information from his relatives and children, the family butler, neighbours, colonists and former shipmates. He included mankind in his speculations from the outset, and on seeing an orangutan in the zoo on 28 March 1838 noted its childlike behaviour.\nThe strain took a toll, and by June he was being laid up for days on end with stomach problems, headaches and heart symptoms. For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe boils, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of Darwin\'s illness remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had only ephemeral success.\nOn 23 June, he took a break and went ""geologising"" in Scotland. He visited Glen Roy in glorious weather to see the parallel ""roads"" cut into the hillsides at three heights. He later published his view that these were marine-raised beaches, but then had to accept that they were shorelines of a proglacial lake.\n\nFully recuperated, he returned to Shrewsbury in July 1838. Used to jotting down daily notes on animal breeding, he scrawled rambling thoughts about marriage, career and prospects on two scraps of paper, one with columns headed ""Marry"" and ""Not Marry"". Advantages under ""Marry"" included ""constant companion and a friend in old age ... better than a dog anyhow"", against points such as ""less money for books"" and ""terrible loss of time"". Having decided in favour of marriage, he discussed it with his father, then went to visit his cousin Emma on 29 July. At this time he did not get around to proposing, but against his father\'s advice, he mentioned his ideas on transmutation.\nHe married Emma on 29 January 1839 and they were the parents of ten children, seven of whom survived to adulthood.']","
Darwin's health deteriorated during the period he was working on his scientific projects due to a combination of factors, including ""an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart,"" frequent stomach problems, headaches, and heart symptoms, leading to episodes of illness, incapacity, and prolonged periods of recovery.

25,How did Darwin's theory of evolution influence the perception of prehistory among the public?,"['In response to objections that the origin of life was unexplained, Darwin pointed to acceptance of Newton\'s law even though the cause of gravity was unknown. Despite criticisms and reservations related to this topic, he nevertheless proposed a prescient idea in an 1871 letter to Hooker in which he suggested the origin of life may have occurred in a ""warm little pond"".\nDarwinism became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863, Lyell\'s Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley\'s Evidence as to Man\'s Place in Nature showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then The Naturalist on the River Amazons by Henry Walter Bates provided empirical evidence of natural selection. Lobbying brought Darwin Britain\'s highest scientific honour, the Royal Society\'s Copley Medal, awarded on 3 November 1864. That day, Huxley held the first meeting of what became the influential ""X Club"" devoted to ""science, pure and free, untrammelled by religious dogmas"". By the end of the decade, most scientists agreed that evolution occurred, but only a minority supported Darwin\'s view that the chief mechanism was natural selection.\nThe Origin of Species was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the ""working men"" who flocked to Huxley\'s lectures. Darwin\'s theory resonated with various movements at the time[V] and became a key fixture of popular culture.[VI] Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain, these droll images served to popularise Darwin\'s theory in an unthreatening way. While ill in 1862, Darwin began growing a beard, and when he reappeared in public in 1866, caricatures of him as an ape helped to identify all forms of evolutionism with Darwinism.\nOthniel C. Marsh, America\'s first palaeontologist, was the first to provide solid fossil evidence to support Darwin\'s theory of evolution by unearthing the ancestors of the modern horse.  In 1877, Marsh delivered a very influential speech before the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, providing a demonstrative argument for evolution.  For the first time, Marsh traced the evolution of vertebrates from fish all the way through humans.  Sparing no detail, he listed a wealth of fossil examples of past life forms.  The significance of this speech was immediately recognized by the scientific community, and it was printed in its entirety in several scientific journals.']","

6,"How did Charles Darwin's family's belief in Unitarianism influence his philosophical perspective, specifically regarding concepts of evolution and descent?","['== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\n\nDarwin was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family\'s home, The Mount. He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier Robert Darwin and Susannah Darwin (née Wedgwood). His grandfathers Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood were both prominent abolitionists. Erasmus Darwin had praised general concepts of evolution and common descent in his Zoonomia (1794), a poetic fantasy of gradual creation including undeveloped ideas anticipating concepts his grandson expanded.\n\nBoth families were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad\'s Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the local Unitarian Church with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus in attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.\nDarwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the well-regarded University of Edinburgh Medical School with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned taxidermy in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from John Edmonstone, a freed black slave who had accompanied Charles Waterton in the South American rainforest.\nIn Darwin\'s second year at the university, he joined the Plinian Society, a student natural-history group featuring lively debates in which radical democratic students with materialistic views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science. He assisted Robert Edmond Grant\'s investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of marine invertebrates in the Firth of Forth, and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech. One day, Grant praised Lamarck\'s evolutionary ideas. Darwin was astonished by Grant\'s audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus\' journals. Darwin was rather bored by Robert Jameson\'s natural-history course, which covered geology – including the debate between neptunism and plutonism. He learned the classification of plants and assisted with work on the collections of the University Museum, one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.\nDarwin\'s neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who sent him to Christ\'s College, Cambridge, in January 1828, to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country parson. Darwin was unqualified for Cambridge\'s Tripos exams and was required instead to join the ordinary degree course. He preferred riding and shooting to studying.\n\nDuring the first few months of Darwin\'s enrolment at Christ\'s College, his second cousin William Darwin Fox was still studying there. Fox impressed him with his butterfly collection, introducing Darwin to entomology and influencing him to pursue beetle collecting. He did this zealously and had some of his finds published in James Francis Stephens\' Illustrations of British entomology (1829–1932).\nThrough Fox, Darwin became a close friend and follower of botany professor John Stevens Henslow. He met other leading parson-naturalists who saw scientific work as religious natural theology, becoming known to these dons as ""the man who walks with Henslow"". When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of William Paley\'s Evidences of Christianity (1795). In his final examination in January 1831, Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ordinary degree.\nDarwin had to stay at Cambridge until June 1831. He studied Paley\'s Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity (first published in 1802), which made an argument for divine design in nature, explaining adaptation as God acting through laws of nature. He read John Herschel\'s new book, Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1831), which described the highest aim of natural philosophy as understanding such laws through inductive reasoning based on observation, and Alexander von Humboldt\'s Personal Narrative of scientific travels in 1799–1804. Inspired with ""a burning zeal"" to contribute, Darwin planned to visit Tenerife with some classmates after graduation to study natural history in the tropics. In preparation, he joined Adam Sedgwick\'s geology course, then on 4 August travelled with him to spend a fortnight mapping strata in Wales.']","
Charles Darwin's family's belief in Unitarianism, while not explicitly stated in the information, heavily influenced his philosophical perspective. His family’s adherence to Unitarianism fostered a tolerance for diverse religious ideas and a questioning approach towards traditional doctrines. It fostered an appreciation for free thought and a questioning of established religious authorities. While it didn't directly shape his evolutionary ideas, the family's openness to various beliefs, including some religious, provided a fertile ground for him to consider alternative explanations for natural phenomena.  Furthermore, Darwin's upbringing in an environment that valued critical thinking and independent inquiry, fostered by his family, directly contributed to his intellectual curiosity and his willingness to challenge conventional thinking.

145,Describe the structure and content Darwin intended for his volume in the planned series of publications. How did he plan to organize the information within it?,"['=== Journal and remarks ===\nSoon after Darwin\'s return, he was at a party hosted by Fanny and Hensleigh Wedgwood for their relatives on 4 December 1836. They agreed to review his journal. The physician and travel writer Henry Holland looked at some pages and ""thought that it would not be worth while to publish it alone, as it would be partly going over the same ground with the Captain"", leaving Darwin ""more perplexed"" but ""becoming rather inclined to the plan of mixing up long passages with Capt Fitzroy."" He would ""go on with the geology and let the journal take care of itself"", but Emma Wedgwood did not think Holland ""any judge as to what is amusing or interesting"", and like Catherine thought it should be published by itself, not ""mixed up with Capt. FitzRoy\'s"". Fanny and Hensleigh found the ""Journal so interesting, that it is quite difficult to stop to criticize"". Though ""not in general a good reader of travels"", he ""found no part of yours tedious."" They had ""read a great deal of it aloud too"" as a more severe test, and concluded it had ""more variety and a greater number of interesting portions"" than other travel books, ""the less it is mixed up with the Captains the better."" \nAfter advice from Broderip, FitzRoy wrote on 30 December that ""One volume might be for King—another for you—and a third for me. The profits if any, to be divided into three equal portions—What think you of such a plan?"" Darwin agreed, and began work on his volume. In March he told Fox ""I am now hard at work and give up every thing else for it. Our plan is as follows.— Capt. FitzRoy writes two volumes, out of the materials collected during both the last voyage under Capt. King to T. del Fuego and during our circumnavigation.— I am to have the third volume, in which I intend giving a kind of journal of a naturalist, not following however always the order of time, but rather the order of position.— The habits of animals will occupy a large portion, sketches of the geology, the appearance of the country, and personal details will make the hodge-podge complete.— Afterwards I shall write an account of the geology in detail, and draw up some Zoological papers.— So that I have plenty of work, for the next year or two, and till that is finished I will have no holidays.""']","Charles Darwin intended for his volume in the planned series of publications to be structured as a ""kind of journal of a naturalist."" Unlike a traditional chronological account, he aimed to organize the content based on the order of position rather than strictly following the sequence of events. This approach allowed him to focus more on thematic elements and specific observations.

The content Darwin planned for his volume included several key components:

1. **Habits of Animals**: A significant portion of the volume was dedicated to exploring the behaviors and characteristics of various animals encountered during the voyage.

2. **Geology**: He intended to provide sketches and insights into the geological aspects observed, offering a glimpse into the earth's structure and composition in different regions visited.

3. **Appearance of the Country**: Descriptions of the landscapes and physical features of the places explored were also planned to be included, giving readers a vivid sense of the environments encountered.

4. **Personal Details**: Darwin aimed to incorporate personal anecdotes and reflections, adding depth and context to his scientific observations.

Overall, Darwin's volume was designed as a comprehensive ""hodge-podge"" that combined natural history with personal narrative, providing a richly detailed account of his experiences and findings during the voyage. This structure allowed him to delve deeply into specific topics while maintaining an engaging and varied narrative style.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4),./data/8_wiki_pages.csv
67,The General Council’s role in the university’s governance is primarily focused on what key areas?,"[""==== General Council ====\nThe General Council consists of graduates, academic staff, current and former University Court members. It was established to ensure that graduates have a continuing voice in the management of the university. The Council is required to meet twice per year to consider matters affecting the wellbeing and prosperity of the university. The Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 gave the Council the power to consider draft ordinances and resolutions, to be presented with an annual report of the work and activities of the university, and to receive an audited financial statement. The Council elects the chancellor of the university and three Assessors on the University Court.\n\n\n==== Senatus Academicus ====\nThe Senatus Academicus is the university's supreme academic body, chaired by the principal and consisting of the professors, heads of departments, and a number of readers, lecturers and other teaching and research staff. The core function of the Senatus is to regulate and supervise the teaching and discipline of the university and to promote research. The Senatus elects four Assessors on the University Court. The Senatus meets three times per year, hosting a presentation and discussion session which is open to all members of staff at each meeting.\n\n\n==== University officials ====\n\nThe university's three most significant officials are its chancellor, rector, and principal, whose rights and responsibilities are largely derived from the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.\nThe office of chancellor serves as the titular head and highest office of the university. Their duties include conferring degrees and enhancing the profile and reputation of the university on national and global levels. The chancellor is elected by the university's General Council, and a person generally remains in the office for life. Previous chancellors include former prime minister Arthur Balfour and novelist Sir J. M. Barrie. Princess Anne has held the position since March 2011 succeeding Prince Philip. She is also Patron of the university's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.\nThe principal is responsible for the overall operation of the university in a chief executive role. The principal is formally nominated by the Curators of Patronage and appointed by the University Court. They are the President of the Senatus Academicus and a member of the University Court ex officio. The principal is also automatically appointed vice-chancellor, in which role they confer degrees on behalf of the chancellor. Previous principals include physicist Sir Edward Appleton and religious philosopher Stewart Sutherland. The current principal is nephrologist Sir Peter Mathieson, who has held the position since February 2018.\nThe office of rector is elected every three years by the staff and matriculated students. The primary role of the rector is to preside at the University Court. The rector also chairs meetings of the General Council in absence of the chancellor. They work closely with students and Edinburgh University Students' Association. Previous rectors include microbiologist Sir Alexander Fleming, and former Prime Ministers Sir Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George. The current rector is activist and writer Simon Fanshawe, who has held the position since March 2024.\n\n\n=== Colleges and schools ===\nIn 2002, the university was reorganised from its nine faculties into three 'Colleges'. While technically not a collegiate university, it comprises the Colleges of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (CAHSS), Science & Engineering (CSE) and Medicine & Vet Medicine (CMVM). Within these colleges are 'Schools', which either represent one academic discipline such as Informatics or assemble adjacent academic disciplines such as the School of History, Classics and Archaeology. While bound by College-level policies, individual Schools can differ in their organisation and governance. As of 2021, the university has 21 schools in total.\n\n\n==== Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences ====\n\nThe College took on its current name of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences in 2016 after absorbing the Edinburgh College of Art in 2011. CAHSS offers more than 280 undergraduate degree programmes, 230 taught postgraduate programmes, and 200 research postgraduate programmes. Twenty subjects offered by the college were ranked within the top 10 nationally in the 2022 Complete University Guide. It includes the oldest English Literature department in Britain, which was ranked 7th globally in the 2021 QS Rankings by Subject in English Language & Literature. The college hosts Scotland's ESRC Doctoral Training Centre (DTC), the Scottish Graduate School of Social Science. The college is the largest of the three colleges by enrolment, with 26,130 students and 3,089 academic staff.""]","

90,"What were the key tensions that emerged between Emma and Charles Darwin regarding their differing views on God and the nature of belief, and how did they seek to resolve these tensions?","['== Religious views ==\nEmma\'s religious beliefs were founded on Unitarianism, which emphasises inner feeling over the authority of religious texts or doctrine. Her views were not simple and unwavering, and were the result of intensive study and questioning.\nDarwin was open about his scepticism before they became engaged, and she discussed with him the tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Following their marriage, they shared discussions about Christianity for several years. She valued his openness, and his genuine uncertainty regarding the existence and nature of God, which gradually developed into agnosticism. This may have been a bond between them, without necessarily resolving the tensions between their views.\n\nBy early 1837 Charles Darwin was already speculating on transmutation of species. Having decided to marry, he visited Emma on 29 July 1838 and told her of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November 1838, he returned and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote to him: ""When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep out of my head but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviour\'s farewell discourse to his disciples which begins at the end of the 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don\'t wish you to give me your opinion about it.""\nDarwin had already wondered about the materialism implied by his ideas. The letter shows Emma\'s tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Emma cherished a belief in the afterlife, and was concerned that they should ""belong to each other"" for eternity. The passage in the Gospel of John referred to in Emma\'s letter says ""Love one another"" (13:34), then describes Jesus  saying ""I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"" (14:6). Desmond and Moore note that the section continues: ""Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned"" (15:6). As disbelief later gradually crept over Darwin, he could ""hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine.""\nFollowing their marriage in January 1839, they shared discussions about Christianity for many years. They socialised with the Unitarian clergymen James Martineau and John James Tayler, and read their works as well as those of other Unitarian and liberal Anglican authors such as Francis William Newman whose Phases of faith described a spiritual journey from Calvinism to theism, all part of widespread and heated debate on the authority of Anglicanism. In Downe Emma attended the Anglican village church, but as a Unitarian had the family turn round in silence when the Trinitarian Nicene Creed was recited.\nSoon after their marriage, Emma wrote to Charles ""while you are acting conscientiously & sincerely wishing, & trying to learn the truth, you cannot be wrong"", and although concerned at the threat to faith of the ""habit in scientific pursuits of believing nothing till it is proved"", her hope that he did not ""consider his opinion as formed"" proved correct. Methodical conscientious doubt as a state of inquiry rather than disbelief made him open to nature and revelation, and they remained open with each other.']","
The key tensions emerged between Emma and Charles Darwin regarding their differing views on God and the nature of belief, primarily centered around the concept of God's existence and the ability to doubt. Emma's views were characterized by her desire for a profound, personal connection with God and her fear of division and disagreement with him, while Darwin’s skepticism was based on a need to explore and question the material implications of his ideas. They sought to resolve these tensions through open communication, shared discussions about Christianity, and a mutual appreciation for each other's perspectives. Specifically, Emma wanted a belief in God, while Darwin's skepticism suggested a need to question the existence of God. Emma, through her anxieties over the potential for division, sought a faith that fostered deep personal connection, while Darwin sought an acceptance of a worldview that allowed for the possibility of doubt.

A corona – a crown-like architectural feature – was suggested to be built around the lantern over the central crossing, replacing an existing pyramidal structure dating from the 1950s. This was part of a wider £23-million development of the abbey completed in 2013. On 4 August 2010, the Dean and Chapter announced that, ""after a considerable amount of preliminary and exploratory work"", efforts toward the construction of a corona would not be continued.\nThe Cosmati pavement underwent a major cleaning and restoration programme for two years, beginning in 2008. On 17 September 2010, Pope Benedict XVI became the first pope to set foot in the abbey when he participated in a service of evening prayer with archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. On 29 April 2011, the abbey hosted the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.\nIn 2018, the Queen\'s Diamond Jubilee Galleries were opened. Located in the medieval triforium, high up around the sanctuary, they are areas for displaying the abbey\'s treasures. A new Gothic access tower with a lift was designed by the abbey architect and Surveyor of the Fabric, Ptolemy Dean.\nIn 2020, a 13th-century sacristy was uncovered in the grounds of the abbey as part of an archaeological excavation. The sacristy was used by the monks of the abbey to store objects used in Mass, such as vestments and chalices. Also on the site were hundreds of buried bodies, mostly of abbey monks.

10,"What role did the ship's captain, Robert FitzRoy, play in Darwin's voyage?","['=== Survey voyage on HMS Beagle ===\n\nAfter leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a few days with student friends at Barmouth. He returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) naturalist for a self-funded supernumerary place on HMS Beagle with captain Robert FitzRoy, a position for a gentleman rather than ""a mere collector"". The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America. Robert Darwin objected to his son\'s planned two-year voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, Josiah Wedgwood II, to agree to (and fund) his son\'s participation. Darwin took care to remain in a private capacity to retain control over his collection, intending it for a major scientific institution.\nAfter delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations. At intervals during the voyage, his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas, was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected during a calm spell.\n\nOn their first stop ashore at St Jago in Cape Verde, Darwin found that a white band high in the volcanic rock cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of Charles Lyell\'s Principles of Geology, which set out uniformitarian concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,[II] and Darwin saw things Lyell\'s way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology. When they reached Brazil, Darwin was delighted by the tropical forest, but detested the sight of slavery there, and disputed this issue with FitzRoy.\nThe survey continued to the south in Patagonia. They stopped at Bahía Blanca, and in cliffs near Punta Alta Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct mammals beside modern seashells, indicating recent extinction with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He found bony plates like a giant version of the armour on local armadillos. From a jaw and tooth he identified the gigantic Megatherium, then from Cuvier\'s description thought the armour was from this animal. The finds were shipped to England, and scientists found the fossils of great interest. In Patagonia, Darwin came to wrongly believe the territory was devoid of reptiles.\nOn rides with gauchos into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, Darwin gained social, political and anthropological insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of rhea had separate but overlapping territories. Further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as raised beaches at a series of elevations. He read Lyell\'s second volume and accepted its view of ""centres of creation"" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell\'s ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.\nThree Fuegians on board, who had been seized during the first Beagle voyage then given Christian education in England, were returning with a missionary. Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at Tierra del Fuego he met ""miserable, degraded savages"", as different as wild from domesticated animals. He remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with a shared origin and potential for improvement towards civilisation. Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. A year on, the mission had been abandoned. The Fuegian they had named Jemmy Button lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.\n\nDarwin experienced an earthquake in Chile in 1835 and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including mussel-beds stranded above high tide. High in the Andes he saw seashells and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, oceanic islands sank, and coral reefs round them grew to form atolls.\nOn the geologically new Galápagos Islands, Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older ""centre of creation"", and found mockingbirds allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island.']","
Robert FitzRoy played a crucial role in the voyage as the ship's captain. He was responsible for leading the expedition and providing the leadership, navigation, and command.

When was it officially named after him?","['== Legacy ==\n\nThe Sedgwick Club, the oldest student-run geological society in the world, was set up in honour of him in 1880.\nOn the death of Sedgwick it was decided that his memorial should take the form of a new and larger museum. There was brief, later discarded, talk of opening a Sedgwick youth summer programme. Hitherto the geological collections had been placed in the Woodwardian Museum in Cockerell\'s Building. Through the energy of Professor T. McK. Hughes (successor to Sedgwick) the new building, termed the Sedgwick Museum, was completed and opened in 1903.\nIn 1865, the University of Cambridge received from A. A. Van Sittart the sum of 500 pounds sterling ""for the purpose of encouraging the study of geology among the resident members of the university, and in honour of the Rev. Adam Sedgwick"". Thus was founded the Sedgwick Prize to be given every third year for the best essay on some geological subject. The first Sedgwick Prize was awarded in 1873 and has continued into the 21st century.\nTo celebrate the bicentenary of Sedgwick\'s birth a geological trail was created near Dent, the village where he was born and developed his passion for geology (amongst other things).

The university fell four places in GPA when compared to the 2014 REF, but retained its place in research power. 90 per cent of the university\'s research activity was judged to be \'world leading\' (4*) or \'internationally excellent\' (3*), and five departments – Computer Science, Informatics, Sociology, Anthropology, and Development Studies – were ranked as the best in the UK.\nIn the 2015 THE Global Employability University Ranking, Edinburgh ranked 23rd in the world and 4th in the UK for graduate employability as voted by international recruiters. A 2015 government report found that Edinburgh was one of only two Scottish universities (along with St Andrews) that some London-based elite recruitment firms considered applicants from, especially in the field of financial services and investment banking. When The New York Times ranked universities based on the employability of graduates as evaluated by recruiters from top companies in 20 countries in 2012, Edinburgh was placed at 42nd in the world and 7th in Britain.\nEdinburgh was ranked 24th in the world and 5th in the UK by the 2021 Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities, a league table based on the three major world university rankings, ARWU, QS and THE.

In 2023, it ranked 73rd amongst the universities around the world by the SCImago Institutions Rankings.\nThe disparity between Edinburgh\'s research capacity, endowment and international status on the one hand, and its ranking in national league tables on the other, is largely due to the impact of measures of \'student satisfaction\'. Edinburgh was ranked last in the UK for teaching quality in the 2012 National Student Survey, with the 2015 Good University Guide stating that this stemmed from ""questions to do with the promptness, usefulness and extent of academic feedback"", and that the university ""still has a long way to go to turn around a poor position"". Edinburgh improved only marginally over the next years, with the 2021 Good University Guide still ranking it in the bottom 10 domestically in both teaching quality and student experience. Edinburgh was ranked 122nd out of 128 universities for student satisfaction in the 2022 Complete University Guide, although it was ranked 12th overall. The 2024 Guardian University Guide ranked Edinburgh 14th overall, but 50th out of 120 universities in teaching satisfaction, and lowest among all universities in satisfaction with feedback.\nIn the 2022 Complete University Guide, 32 out of the 49 subjects offered by Edinburgh were ranked within the top 10 in the UK, with Asian Studies (4th), Chemical Engineering (4th), Education (2nd), Geology (5th), Linguistics (5th), Mechanical Engineering (5th), Medicine (5th), Music (5th), Nursing (1st), Physics & Astronomy (5th), Social Policy (5th), Theology & Religious Studies (4th), and Veterinary Medicine (2nd) within the top 5.

Edinburgh’s research capacity is arguably its key strength. It boasts a strong record of leading research, evidenced by its high rankings in the REF, THE Global Employability University Ranking, and Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities. Specifically, it’s known for world-leading research activity in areas such as Computer Science, Informatics, Sociology, Anthropology, and Development Studies, and a significant number of research departments are ranked as best in the UK. 
However, Edinburgh’s endowment and international status are weaknesses. The university’s ranking in the 2022 U.S. News & World Report is considerably lower than its peers, indicating a comparatively smaller financial resource. Furthermore, there is an ongoing perception and historical trend of ""student satisfaction"" being a significant constraint. While improvements have been made, Edinburgh consistently struggles to maintain its position in national league tables, particularly in teaching quality and student experience, leading to a noticeable disparity. Furthermore, the 2023 SCImago Institutions Ranking put Edinburgh at the bottom of the world.

102,What were the primary arguments presented by Sedgwick in his letter to Darwin?,"['The two kept up a correspondence while Darwin was on the Beagle expedition, and afterwards.  However, Sedgwick never accepted the case for evolution made in On the Origin of Species in 1859 any more than he did that in  Vestiges in 1844.  In response to receiving and reading Darwin\'s book, he wrote to Darwin saying:\n\nIf I did not think you a good tempered & truth loving man I should not tell you that... I have read your book with more pain than pleasure. Parts of it I admired greatly; parts I laughed at till my sides were almost sore; other parts I read with absolute sorrow; because I think them utterly false & grievously mischievous – You have deserted—after a start in that tram-road of all solid physical truth—the true method of induction—& started up a machinery as wild I think as Bishop Wilkins\'s locomotive that was to sail with us to the Moon. Many of your wide conclusions are based upon assumptions which can neither be proved nor disproved. Why then express them in the language & arrangements of philosophical induction?\nSedgwick regarded natural selection as\n\nbut a secondary consequence of supposed, or known, primary facts. Development is a better word because more close to the cause of the fact. For you do not deny causation. I call (in the abstract) causation the will of God: & I can prove that He acts for the good of His creatures. He also acts by laws which we can study &  comprehend—Acting by law, & under what is called final cause, comprehends, I think, your whole principle ...\nHe emphasised his distinction between the moral and physical aspects of life, ""There is a moral or metaphysical part of nature as well as a physical. A man who denies this is deep in the mire of folly"". If humanity broke this distinction it ""would suffer a damage that might brutalize it—& sink the human race into a lower grade of degradation than any into which it has fallen since its written records tell us of its history"".\nIn a letter to another correspondent, Sedgwick was even harsher on Darwin\'s book, calling it ""utterly false"" and writing that ""It repudiates all reasoning from final causes; and seems to shut the door on any view (however feeble) of the God of Nature as manifested in His works. From first to last it is a dish of rank materialism cleverly cooked and served up"".\nDespite this difference of opinion, the two men remained friendly until Sedgwick\'s death. In contrast to Sedgwick, liberal church members (who included biologists such as George Rolleston, William Henry Flower and William Kitchen Parker) were usually comfortable with evolution.\n\n\n== Links and opposition to slavery ==\nAs a co-trustee of the will of Ann Sill, an owner of slaves in plantations in Jamaica, in 1835 Sedgwick was awarded half of £3,783 in compensation for 174 slaves, following the abolition of slavery by the British government. Sedgwick is listed in the University College London database, Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave Ownership, as being an awardee in receipt of £3,783 1s 8d on 8 February 1836 for ""174 Enslaved"". He was one of 46,000 people paid compensation during the abolition of slavery in the United Kingdom. A liberal Whig in politics, Sedgwick had long been a passionate supporter of abolition. In a letter to Bishop Wilberforce, dated July 16, 1848, Sedgwick wrote of signing a petition against the slave trade while he was a child—the first ""political act of [his] life""—after his father had shown him ""ugly pictures of the horrors of slavery"".']","
Sedgwick presented the following primary arguments in his letter to Darwin:
1.  He argued that natural selection is a secondary consequence of supposed, or known, primary facts.
2.  He emphasized his distinction between the moral and physical aspects of life, calling (in the abstract) causation the will of God.
3.  He rejected the idea of final causes, implying that it shut the door on any view (however feeble) of the God of Nature as manifested in His works.
4.  He argued that it repudiates all reasoning from final causes, and seems to shut the door on any view (however feeble) of the God of Nature as manifested in His works.

146,"What feedback did Caroline provide about Darwin's early diary entries, and how did it reflect her perception of his writing style?","['=== Darwin\'s diary / journal ===\nOn board the ship, Darwin began a day-to-day record of activities in the form of a diary, which he commonly called ""my Journal"". Darwin wrote entries, in ink, while on the ship or when staying for a period in a house on shore. When travelling on land, he left the manuscript on the ship, and made pencil notes in pocket books to record details of his excursions along with his field notes on geology and natural history. He then wrote up his diary entries from these notes or from memory, sometimes several weeks after the event.\nPages 1 and 2, dated 16 December 1831, outline events from Darwin arriving home on 29 August to his arrival at Devonport on 24 October. From page 3 onwards he adopts a consistent layout, with month, the year and place in a heading at the top, page number in a top corner, and the day of the month in the margin at each entry. After delays and false starts due to weather, they set off on 27 December. Darwin suffered seasickness, and his entry for that date starts ""I am now on the 5th of Jan.y writing the memoranda of my misery for the last week"".\nIn April, a month after reaching South America, he wrote to his sister Caroline that he was struggling to write letters, partly due to ""writing everything in my journal"". A few weeks later at Botafogo in Rio de Janeiro, tired and short of time, he sent her ""in a packet, my commonplace Journal.— I have taken a fit of disgust with it & want to get it out of my sight, any of you that like may read it.— a great deal is absolutely childish: Remember however this, that it is written solely to make me remember this voyage, & that it is not a record of facts but of my thoughts"". He invited criticisms. In reply, his sister Catherine praised his ""interesting and entertaining"" descriptions,  ""Susan read the Journal aloud to Papa, who was interested, and liked it very much"". His Wedgwood relatives had asked to see it at Maer Hall. Darwin left that ""entirely in your hands.— I suspect the first part is abominaly childish, if so do not send it to Maer.— Also, do not send it by the Coach, (it may appear ridiculous to you) but I would as soon loose a piece of my memory as it.— I feel it is of such consequence to my preserving a just recollection of the different places we visit.""\nBy 14 July 1833 Darwin had sent more of his diary. On 28 October Caroline gave the requested critical assessment – in the first part Darwin had ""probably from reading so much of Humboldt, got his phraseology & occasionly made use of the kind of flowery french expressions which he uses, instead of your own simple straight forward & far more agreeable style. I have no doubt you have without perceiving it got to embody your ideas in his poetical language & from his being a foreigner it does not sound unnatural in him"". However, ""the greatest part I liked exceedingly & could find no fault"". In July 1834, Darwin agreed that these points were ""perfectly just"", and continued to update his diary carefully.\nAs Beagle headed homewards in April 1836,  Darwin told Caroline that FitzRoy too was busy with writing ""the account of the Voyage"". This ""Book"" might be ""rather diffuse"", but otherwise good: ""his style is very simple & excellent. He has proposed to me, to join him in publishing the account, that is, for him to have the disposal & arranging of my journal & to mingle it with his own. Of course I have said I am perfectly willing, if he wants materials; or thinks the chit-chat details of my journal are any ways worth publishing. He has read over the part, I have on board, & likes it."" Darwin asked his family about this idea, but would be aware the custom of the Navy was that the captain had a right to first use of papers.']","Caroline provided specific feedback on Charles Darwin's early diary entries. She noted that in the first part of his journal, Darwin seemed to have been influenced by Alexander von Humboldt, adopting a similar phraseology and occasionally using ""flowery French expressions"" instead of his own straightforward style. Caroline observed that this made Darwin's writing sound more poetic and less natural for him as an English writer. Despite these stylistic influences, she expressed overall appreciation for the journal, stating that she liked ""the greatest part exceedingly"" and found no fault with it.

Caroline's feedback reflects her perception of Darwin's writing style as initially being overly influenced by another author's language, which made it less direct and simple than his usual manner. However, she also recognized the value in his descriptions and overall content, indicating that despite these stylistic choices, the journal was still engaging and well-received. Her comments suggest an awareness of Darwin's potential to improve by returning to a more natural and straightforward style while maintaining the quality of his observations and reflections.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4),./data/The_Voyage_of_the_Beagle.csv
2,What was the primary reason Sedgwick initially rejected the prevailing geological theories and what were the key factors leading to this shift in his thinking?,"['Sedgwick\'s subsequent investigations and discussions with continental geologists persuaded him that this was problematic. In early 1827, after spending several weeks in Paris, he visited geological features in the Scottish Highlands with Roderick Murchison. He later wrote ""If I have been converted in part from the diluvian theory...it was...by my own gradual improved experience, and by communicating with those about me. Perhaps I may date my change of mind (at least in part) from our journey in the Highlands, where there are so many indications of local diluvial operations.... Humboldt ridiculed [the doctrine] beyond measure when I met him in Paris. Prévost lectured against it.""  In response to Charles Lyell\'s 1830 publication, Principles of Geology, which is known for promoting uniformitarian geology Sedgwick talked of floods at various dates, then on 18 February 1831 when retiring from the Presidency of the Geological Society he recanted his former belief in Buckland\'s theory.\nHe strongly believed that species of organisms originated in a succession of Divine creative acts throughout the long expanse of history. Any form of development that denied a direct creative action smacked as materialistic and amoral. For Sedgwick, moral truths (the obtainment of which separates man from beast) were to be distinguished from physical truths, and to combine these or blur them together could only lead to disastrous consequences. In fact, one\'s own hope for immortality may ultimately rest on it.\nHe stated in 1830 that scriptural geologists proposed ""a deformed progeny of heretical and fantastical conclusions, by which sober philosophy has been put to open shame, and sometimes even the charities of life have been exposed to violation."" In 1834 he continued, ""They have committed the folly and SIN of dogmatizing,"" having ""sinned against plain sense,"" and ""of writing mischievous nonsense,"" ""Their eyes cannot bear to look upon"" truth and suppose an ""ignorant and dishonest"" theory.  They show ""bigotry and ignorance,"" of nature\'s laws and natural phenomena. Henry Cole then responded in 1834 in a 136-page ""letter,"" Popular Geology Subversive of Divine Revelation. He referred to Sedgwick\'s ideas as ""unscriptural and anti-Christian,"" ""scripture-defying"", ""revelation-subverting,"" and ""baseless speculations and self-contradictions,"" which were ""impious and infidel"".\nWhile he became increasingly Evangelical with age, he strongly supported advances in geology against conservative churchmen. At the September 1844 British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting at York he achieved national celebrity for his reply defending modern geology against an attack by the Dean of York, the Reverend William Cockburn, who described it as unscriptural. The entire chapter house of the cathedral refused to sit down with Sedgwick, and he was opposed by conservative papers including The Times, but his courage was hailed by the full spectrum of the liberal press, and the confrontation was a key moment in the battle over relations between Scripture and science.\n\nWhen Robert Chambers anonymously published his own theory of universal evolutionism as his ""development hypothesis"" in the book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation published in October 1844 to immediate popular success, Sedgwick\'s many friends urged him to respond. Like other eminent scientists he initially ignored the book, but the subject kept recurring and he then read it carefully and made a withering attack on the book in the July 1845 edition of the Edinburgh Review. Vestiges ""comes before [its readers] with a bright, polished, and many-coloured surface, and the serpent coils a false philosophy, and asks them to stretch out their hands and pluck the forbidden fruit"", he wrote in his review. Accepting the arguments in Vestiges was akin to falling from grace and away from God\'s favour.\nHe lashed out at the book in a letter to Charles Lyell, bemoaning the consequences of it conclusions. ""...If the book be true, the labours of sober induction are in vain; religion is a lie; human law is a mass of folly, and a base injustice; morality is moonshine; our labours for the black people of Africa were works of madmen; and man and woman are only better beasts!"" Later, Sedgwick added a long preface to the 5th edition of his Discourse on the Studies of the University of Cambridge (1850), including a lengthy attack on Vestiges and theories of development in general.\nCharles Darwin was one of his geology students in 1831, and accompanied him on a field trip to Wales that summer. The two kept up a correspondence while Darwin was on the Beagle expedition, and afterwards.']","
Sedgwick initially rejected the prevailing geological theories primarily because he was deeply influenced by continental geologists, particularly those of Louis Frédéric and Roderick Murchison. He was also persuaded by the ideas of Humboldt and Prévost, whom he considered to be misguided. These influences combined with his own gradual improved experience and communication with those around him led to a shift in his thinking, where he began to question the accepted models of geological development and sought to formulate his own, grounded in a divine creative act.
