When Reid\'s descendants were unwilling to pay out the sum, the town council petitioned King James VI and his Privy Council.

At the time, the college mainly covered liberal arts and divinity. Instruction began under the charge of a graduate from the University of St Andrews, theologian Robert Rollock, who first served as Regent, and from 1586 as principal of the college.

In Edinburgh, this led to the dismissal of Principal Alexander Monro and several professors and regents after a government visitation in 1690. The university was subsequently led by Principal Gilbert Rule, one of the inquisitors on the visitation committee.\n\n\n=== 18th and 19th century ===\n\nThe late 17th and early 18th centuries were marked by a power struggle between the university and town council, which had ultimate authority over staff appointments, curricula, and examinations.

The emphasis on rhetoric and poetry reflected Reid's broader educational goals, aiming to cultivate skills in communication and literary expression. These subjects were not commonly prioritized in the traditional university settings of 16th-century Scotland or elsewhere in Europe, where education was largely dominated by religious and classical studies due to their association with clerical training and scholarly tradition.

1. **Organizational Structure**: 
   - The university was organized as a single entity rather than being composed of loosely connected colleges. This centralized organization facilitated academic exchange and collaboration among faculty members, which was crucial for fostering innovative ideas.
   - It adopted a Dutch model of professorship, replacing the regenting system with a more flexible structure where professors specialized in different subjects. This allowed students to learn from multiple experts rather than being taught by a single instructor throughout their studies, promoting a broader and more diverse intellectual environment.

2. **Lack of Land Endowments**:
   - Unlike many other universities that relied on land endowments for income, Edinburgh University operated without such financial security. This lack of guaranteed funding created a competitive atmosphere among faculty members, who were motivated to excel in their fields to attract students and secure their positions.
   - The need to compete for resources likely encouraged innovation and excellence, as professors sought to enhance the university's reputation through groundbreaking research and teaching.

Together, these factors created an environment conducive to intellectual growth and exchange. This setting attracted and nurtured key figures of the Enlightenment, such as Joseph Black, Adam Smith, David Hume, and others, who contributed significantly to various fields of knowledge. The competitive yet collaborative atmosphere at Edinburgh University was instrumental in establishing it as a leading center for scientific and philosophical thought during this period.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4)

The site was used to construct Old College, the university\'s first custom-built building, by architect William Henry Playfair to plans by Robert Adam. During the 18th century, the university developed a particular forte in teaching anatomy and the developing science of surgery, and it was considered one of the best medical schools in the English-speaking world. Bodies to be used for dissection were brought to the university\'s Anatomy Theatre through a secret tunnel from a nearby house (today\'s College Wynd student accommodation), which was also used by murderers Burke and Hare to deliver the corpses of their victims during the 1820s.\nThe Edinburgh snowball riots of 1838 also known as the \'Wars of the Quadrangle\' occurred when University of Edinburgh students engaged in what started as a snowball fight in ""a spirit of harmless amusement"" before becoming a two-day \'battle\' at Old College with local Edinburgh residents on South Bridge which led to the Lord Provost calling from the 79th regiment to be called from Edinburgh Castle to quell the disturbance. This was later immortalised in a 92-page humorous account written by the students entitled The University Snowdrop and then later, in 1853, in a landscape by English artist, Samuel Bough.\n\nAfter 275 years of governance by the town council, the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858 gave the university full authority over its own affairs. The act established governing bodies including a university court and a general council, and redefined the roles of key officials like the chancellor, rector, and principal.\n\nThe Edinburgh Seven were the first group of matriculated undergraduate female students at any British university. Led by Sophia Jex-Blake, they began studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1869. Although the university blocked them from graduating and qualifying as doctors, their campaign gained national attention and won them many supporters, including Charles Darwin. Their efforts put the rights of women to higher education on the national political agenda, which eventually resulted in legislation allowing women to study at all Scottish universities in 1889. The university admitted women to graduate in medicine in 1893. In 2015, the Edinburgh Seven were commemorated with a plaque at the university, and in 2019 they were posthumously awarded with medical degrees.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, Old College was becoming overcrowded. After a bequest from Sir David Baxter, the university started planning new buildings in earnest. Sir Robert Rowand Anderson won the public architectural competition and was commissioned to design new premises for the Medical School in 1877. Initially, the design incorporated a campanile and a hall for examination and graduation, but this was seen as too ambitious. The new Medical School opened in 1884, but the building was not completed until 1888. After funds were donated by politician and brewer William McEwan in 1894, a separate graduation building was constructed after all, also designed by Anderson. The resulting McEwan Hall on Bristo Square was presented to the university in 1897.\n\nThe Students\' Representative Council (SRC) was founded in 1884 by student Robert Fitzroy Bell.

One of the primary goals of this legislative act was to provide a dedicated location for the university, which at that time operated out of various buildings without a centralized campus. The introduction of the South Bridge Act facilitated the construction of Old College, marking it as the university's first purpose-built structure.

Architect William Henry Playfair executed the design plans by Robert Adam to create Old College on the site designated by the act. This development was crucial in establishing a more organized and cohesive environment for academic activities at the university. The establishment of Old College not only provided much-needed space but also symbolized the university's commitment to advancing education, particularly in fields like anatomy and surgery, where it had already gained international recognition.

Overall, the South Bridge Act significantly impacted the University of Edinburgh by enabling the construction of a central building that supported its growth as a leading educational institution. This development laid the groundwork for future expansions and enhancements, contributing to the university's reputation as a preeminent scientific and academic center during the Enlightenment period and beyond.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4)

By the time the Royal Society of Edinburgh was founded in 1783, the university was regarded as one of the world\'s preeminent scientific institutions, and Voltaire called Edinburgh a ""hotbed of genius"" as a result. Benjamin Franklin believed that the university possessed ""a set of as truly great men, Professors of the Several Branches of Knowledge, as have ever appeared in any Age or Country"". Thomas Jefferson felt that as far as science was concerned, ""no place in the world can pretend to a competition with Edinburgh"".\n\nIn 1785, Henry Dundas introduced the South Bridge Act in the House of Commons; one of the bill\'s goals was to use South Bridge as a location for the university, which had existed in a hotchpotch of buildings since its establishment. The site was used to construct Old College, the university\'s first custom-built building, by architect William Henry Playfair to plans by Robert Adam. During the 18th century, the university developed a particular forte in teaching anatomy and the developing science of surgery, and it was considered one of the best medical schools in the English-speaking world.

In 1869, they began studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh, marking a significant step toward women's access to higher education in Britain.

Despite facing substantial resistance from the university administration, which blocked them from graduating and qualifying as doctors, Jex-Blake and her fellow students persisted in their campaign for educational equality. Their efforts garnered national attention and attracted support from prominent figures, including Charles Darwin. This visibility helped bring the issue of women's rights to higher education into the public discourse.

The campaign led by Sophia Jex-Blake and the Edinburgh Seven was instrumental in putting pressure on the political system to address gender disparities in education. As a result of their advocacy and the broader movement for women's rights, legislation was eventually passed allowing women to study at all Scottish universities in 1889. This legislative change marked a significant victory for the campaign.

By 1893, the University of Edinburgh had admitted women to graduate in medicine, reflecting the progress made due to the efforts of Jex-Blake and her peers. Their struggle not only opened doors for future generations of female students but also set a precedent for other institutions across Britain to follow suit.

This was replaced with the Informatics Forum on Bristo Square, completed in July 2008. Also in 2002, the Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre (ECRC) was opened on the Western General Hospital site. In 2007, the MRC Human Genetics Unit formed a partnership with the Centre for Genomic & Experimental Medicine and the ECRC to create the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine (renamed the Institute of Genetics and Cancer in 2021) on the same site.\nIn April 2008, the Roslin Institute – an animal sciences research centre known for cloning Dolly the sheep – became part of the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies. In 2011, the school moved into a new £60 million building on the Easter Bush campus, which now houses research and teaching facilities, and a hospital for small and farm animals.\n\nEdinburgh College of Art, founded in 1760, formally merged with the university's School of Arts, Culture and Environment on 1 August 2011. In 2014, the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute (ZJE) was founded as an international joint institute offering degrees in biomedical sciences, taught in English. The campus, located in Haining, Zhejiang Province, China, was established on 15 March 2016.\nThe university began hosting a Wikimedian in Residence in 2016. The residency was made into a full-time position in 2019, with the Wikimedian involved in teaching and learning activities within the scope of the University of Edinburgh WikiProject.\nIn 2018, the University of Edinburgh was a signatory to the £1.3 billion Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal, in partnership with the UK and Scottish governments, six local authorities and all universities and colleges in the region. The university committed to delivering a range of economic benefits to the region through the Data-Driven Innovation initiative. In conjunction with Heriot-Watt University, the deal created five innovation hubs: the Bayes Centre, Edinburgh Futures Institute, Usher Institute, Easter Bush, and one further hub based at Heriot-Watt, the National Robotarium. The deal also included creation of the Edinburgh International Data Facility, which performs high-speed data processing in a secure environment.\nIn September 2020, the university completed work on the Richard Verney Health Centre at its central area campus on Bristo Square. The facility houses a health centre and pharmacy, and the university's disability and counselling services. The university's largest expansion in the 2020s was the conversion of some of the historic Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place, which had been vacated in 2003 and partially developed into the Quartermile. The £120 million project created a home for the Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI), an interdisciplinary hub linking arts, humanities, and social sciences with other disciplines in the research and teaching of complex, multi-stakeholder societal challenges. The EFI officially opened its doors to the public on 4 June 2024.""]","The historic Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place underwent a significant transformation as part of the University of Edinburgh's expansion plans. Initially, these buildings were deemed inadequate for modern medical needs in the 1990s, leading to the development of a new hospital and medical campus in Little France, known as the BioQuarter. However, after vacating the Lauriston Place site in 2003, parts of it were partially developed into the Quartermile.

In the 2020s, the university embarked on an ambitious £120 million project to convert these historic buildings into a new home for the Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI). This interdisciplinary hub aims to link arts, humanities, and social sciences with other disciplines in addressing complex societal challenges through research and teaching. The transformation reflects the university's commitment to fostering innovation and collaboration across various fields.

The EFI officially opened its doors to the public on 4 June 2024, marking a new chapter for the historic site as it becomes an integral part of the university's expansion and interdisciplinary initiatives.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4)

These acts provide for three major bodies in the governance of the university: the University Court, the General Council, and the Senatus Academicus.\n\n\n==== University Court ====\nThe University Court is the university's governing body and the legal person of the university, chaired by the rector and consisting of the principal, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and of Assessors appointed by the rector, chancellor, Edinburgh Town Council, General Council, and Senatus Academicus. By the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889, it is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. All property belonging to the university at the passing of the Act was vested in the Court. The present powers of the Court are further defined in the Universities (Scotland) Act 1966, including the administration and management of the university's revenue and property, the regulation of staff salaries, and the establishment and composition of committees of its own members or others.""]","The building at the Holyrood campus that was opened by Princess Anne in 2017 is O'Shea Hall.

It was established to ensure that graduates have a continuing voice in the management of the university. The Council is required to meet twice per year to consider matters affecting the wellbeing and prosperity of the university. The Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 gave the Council the power to consider draft ordinances and resolutions, to be presented with an annual report of the work and activities of the university, and to receive an audited financial statement. The Council elects the chancellor of the university and three Assessors on the University Court.\n\n\n==== Senatus Academicus ====\nThe Senatus Academicus is the university's supreme academic body, chaired by the principal and consisting of the professors, heads of departments, and a number of readers, lecturers and other teaching and research staff. The core function of the Senatus is to regulate and supervise the teaching and discipline of the university and to promote research. The Senatus elects four Assessors on the University Court. The Senatus meets three times per year, hosting a presentation and discussion session which is open to all members of staff at each meeting.\n\n\n==== University officials ====\n\nThe university's three most significant officials are its chancellor, rector, and principal, whose rights and responsibilities are largely derived from the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.\nThe office of chancellor serves as the titular head and highest office of the university. Their duties include conferring degrees and enhancing the profile and reputation of the university on national and global levels.

Medicine and Veterinary Medicine became one of these, and in 2002 became the smallest of the three colleges, with 7,740 students and 1,896 academic staff. The university\'s teaching hospitals include the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, St John\'s Hospital, Livingston, Roodlands Hospital, and Royal Hospital for Children and Young People.\n\n\n==== Science and Engineering ====\n\nIn the 16th century, science was taught as ""natural philosophy"" in the university. The 17th century saw the institution of the University Chairs of Mathematics and Botany, followed the next century by Chairs of Natural History, Astronomy, Chemistry and Agriculture. It was Edinburgh\'s professors who took a leading part in the formation of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. Joseph Black, Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the time, founded the world\'s first Chemical Society in 1785. The first named degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Science was instituted in 1864, and a separate Faculty of Science was created in 1893 after three centuries of scientific advances at Edinburgh. The Regius Chair in Engineering was established in 1868, and the Regius Chair in Geology in 1871. In 1991 the Faculty of Science was renamed the Faculty of Science and Engineering, and in 2002 it became the College of Science and Engineering. The college has 11,745 students and 2,937 academic staff.\n\n\n==== Sub-units, centres and institutes ====\n\nSome subunits, centres and institutes within the university are listed as follows:\n\n\n=== Finances ===\nIn the financial year ending 31 July 2024, the University of Edinburgh had a total income of £1.386 billion (2022/23 – £1.341 billion) and total expenditure of £1.014 billion (2022/23 – £1.181 billion). Key sources of income included £527.2 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 – £513.7 million), £208.7 million from funding body grants (2022/23 – £210.9 million), £365.2 million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 – £339.5 million), £62.7 million from investment income (2022/23 – £42.2 million) and £25 million from donations and endowments (2022/23 – £55.7 million).\nAt year end, Edinburgh had endowments of £580.4 million (2023 – £559.8 million) and total net assets of £3.003 billion (2023 – £2.615 billion). It holds the third-largest endowment of any university in the UK.\n\n\n=== Staff, community and networking ===\nIn June 2024, the University employed over 12,390 full time equivalent staff, an increase of 508 over the previous year:\n\nAs part of the university\'s support for researchers, each College has Research Staff Societies that include postdoc societies, and organisations specific to each school. Cross-curricula Research Networks bring together researchers working on similar topics.\n\nIndependently of the College hierarchy, aligned with the university\'s EDI policy, eight Staff Networks bring together and represent diverse staff groups:\n\nDisabled Staff Network\nStaff BAME Network\nEdinburgh Race Equality Network\nJewish Staff Network\nStaff Pride Network\nUniversity & College Unions incorporating the national academic union and the in-house Edinburgh University Union\nLong-term Research Staff Network\nSupport for Technicians and Steering Committee']","To analyze the financial trends for the University of Edinburgh between the fiscal years ending July 2023 and July 2024, we can examine the changes in key income sources:

   - The total income increased from £1.341 billion in 2022/23 to £1.386 billion in 2023/24.

2. **Tuition Fees and Education Contracts**:
   - There was an increase in income from tuition fees and education contracts, rising from £513.7 million in 2022/23 to £527.2 million in 2023/24. This indicates a growth of approximately £13.5 million or about 2.6%.

3. **Funding Body Grants**:
   - Income from funding body grants decreased slightly from £210.9 million in 2022/23 to £208.7 million in 2023/24, showing a reduction of around £2.2 million or approximately 1.0%.

4. **Research Grants and Contracts**:
   - There was an increase in income from research grants and contracts, which rose from £339.5 million in 2022/23 to £365.2 million in 2023/24. This represents a growth of about £25.7 million or roughly 7.6%.

5. **Investment Income**:
   - Investment income increased significantly from £42.2 million in 2022/23 to £62.7 million in 2023/24, marking an increase of approximately £20.5 million or around 48.6%.

6. **Donations and Endowments**:
   - Donations and endowments decreased from £55.7 million in 2022/23 to £25 million in 2023/24, a substantial reduction of about £30.7 million or approximately 55.1%.

Overall, the University of Edinburgh experienced an increase in total income primarily driven by growth in tuition fees, research grants, and investment income, despite decreases in funding body grants and donations. This suggests a positive trend in core educational and research activities, although reliance on donations has decreased significantly.",ai (phi4),ai (phi4)

**Significance of the Discovery:**

1. **Chemiosmotic Theory:** Peter D. Mitchell proposed the chemiosmotic theory, which explains how ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is produced in cells. This process occurs during cellular respiration and photosynthesis.

2. **ATP Synthesis Mechanism:** According to the chemiosmotic theory, a proton gradient across a membrane (such as the inner mitochondrial membrane or thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts) drives ATP synthesis. The energy from this gradient is used by the enzyme ATP synthase to convert ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate into ATP.

3. **Fundamental Biological Process:** ATP is often referred to as the ""energy currency"" of the cell because it provides the necessary energy for various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and chemical synthesis.

4. **Impact on Biochemistry:** Mitchell's work fundamentally changed our understanding of bioenergetics and has had a profound impact on fields such as biochemistry, molecular biology, and medicine. It provided insights into how cells harness energy from nutrients and sunlight.

5. **Nobel Prize Recognition:** The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Peter D. Mitchell for his discovery of the chemiosmotic mechanism of ATP synthesis, highlighting its importance in biological sciences.

They became the basis for Robert Louis Stevenson\'s short story The Body Snatcher (1884), and most recently in 2010 for Burke & Hare, a black comedy film starring Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis. Scenes were filmed at the old School of Anatomy.\nMany of Arthur Conan Doyle\'s works drew inspiration from his mentors at the university. Joseph Bell, a lecturer and surgeon famous for drawing conclusions from minute observations, became the archetype for Conan Doyle\'s fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. William Rutherford, Conan Doyle\'s physiology professor provided the template for Professor Challenger, the protagonist of his science fiction work The Lost World (1912). Edinburgh is also Challenger\'s alma mater in the books.\nDr. Fu Manchu, a fictional supervillain created by Sax Rohmer in 1912, stated that ""I am a doctor of philosophy from Edinburgh, a doctor of law from Christ\'s College, a doctor of medicine from Harvard. My friends, out of courtesy, call me \'Doctor\'."" In 2010, Fu Manchu\'s connections with the University where he supposedly obtained a doctorate were investigated in a mockumentary by Miles Jupp (also an Edinburgh alumnus) for BBC Radio 4.\nIn the movie Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959), an adaptation of Jules Verne\'s novel of the same name, the protagonist Sir Oliver Lindenbrook is a Professor of Geology at the university. An early scene where Lindenbrook addresses the students is filmed at the central quadrangle of Old College.\nThe historical film Chariots of Fire (1981) is based on the story of Olympic runner and Edinburgh graduate Eric Liddell, and includes scenes filmed outside of Assembly Hall, New College. Liddell is played by Ian Charleson, who is also an Edinburgh alumnus.\nIn the novel The Last King of Scotland (1998) by Giles Foden, the fictional protagonist Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is a medical doctor recently graduated from Edinburgh. The 2006 film of the same name stars James McAvoy in the role of Dr. Garrigan with the same background.\nIn the American television show NCIS (2003–present), the chief medical examiner, Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard studied medicine at Edinburgh. Ari Haswari, the show\'s main antagonist for the first two seasons, also studied medicine at Edinburgh.\nIn the novel One Day (2009), the lead characters Dexter and Emma both graduated from Edinburgh. A feature film based on the book, also titled One Day and starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess was released in August 2011, with some scenes filmed at the university. A Netflix adaptation of the movie started production in 2021, with filming occurring in the grounds of Old College in 2022.\nThe BBC legal drama Garrow\'s Law (2009–2011) was largely filmed in Edinburgh, despite being set in London. Old College and the Playfair Library are prominently featured.\nThe thriller television series Clique (2017–2019) produced by BBC Three focuses on two students at the university. The series was shot largely on location in Edinburgh, including The Meadows, Old College, and Potterrow.\nFast & Furious 9 (2021), partly set in Edinburgh, featured scenes in and around Old College filmed in September 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==']","The University of Edinburgh has made significant appearances in various works of popular culture, often serving as a backdrop for stories and character development.
